As an embroidery it may rank with the Shaka Nyōrai Preaching, of similar size (207×157cm) and also of the eighth century, from the Kanshū-in, now in the Nara National Museum (see Nihon bukkyō bijutsu no genryū, p.254). Other items of embroidery in the Stein Collection at the British Museum are of a decorative character, but this work must have been equal in importance to the finest and largest of the paradise paintings on silk.</p><p>The composition consists of a five-figured Buddha group, over which appears a canopy with apsarasas, and below are a number of donors. The Buddha stands on a lotus pedestal, beneath the blue canopy. His body is enclosed, to its full height, within an almond-shaped aureole that reaches to just above the nimbus around his head. Behind the mandorla is a rocky surround, representing Mt.Grdhrakūta, or the Vulture Peak, at Rājagrha, the scene of the preaching of the Lotus Sutra. The Buddha stands with his right shoulder uncovered and his right hand extended straight down, while his left grasps the hem of his robe, in the usual posture for Sākyamuni on this occasion (see also Vol.1, Pl.22).</p><p>By good fortune and through the care with which the whole embroidery was folded, the central figure of Sākyamuni has escaped damage altogether, while the two Bodhisattvas have suffered only slight losses. It is the two disciples, already partly hidden behind the Bodhisattvas, who have been damaged the worst: as Stein noted in Serindia (Vol.Ⅱ, p.983), these figures fell along the line of folding when the hanging was put away, “and have for the most part been eaten away. ”Enough of the two figures survives, however, to reveal their individual characters and to show that their robes originally just touched the outermost contours of the rocky cliff. The two Bodhisattvas are almost completely visible. They and the disciples stand on lotus pedestals and seen in three-quarter view. As they are placed just in front of and a little below the disciples, the effect of the whole composition is to form a space enclosing the central Buddha, echoing the arrangement that would have been found if the group had been a sculptural one.</p><p>This feeling for space and volume, despite the medium of embroidery in which it must have been especially difficult to achieve, is in itself powerful evidence of a date of execution early in the Tang dynasty when such concerns are characteristic of both sculpture and painting. That there were sculptural models for Sākyamuni on the Vulture Peak, though distant in time and space, is suggested by the presence of this representation in the New Delhi section of the painting of Famous Buddhist Images (see Vol.2, text figure, p.306), where Sākyamuni appears alone, against a rocky background. In that painting, several features indicate that the figure of Sākyamuni reflects, although not at first hand, a sculpture in stone. Like many of the other figures in the Famous Buddhist Images painting, this one is not coloured, but simply represented in ink outline. The mandorla enclosing the figure is straight at the sides and semicircular at the top, where it completely encloses the nimbus; its form and the small seated Buddha visible above Sākyamuni’s right shoulder strongly suggest that the original model was a free-standing stone stele. Only beyond its confines are there long coloured flames, and outside these the rocky forms of the Vulture Peak shaded in ink and some of them coloured. This seems appropriate in a painting which was primarily a record of famous images.</p><p>Among the wall paintings at Dunhuang, the Sākyamuni Preaching on the Vulture Peak, in Cave 332, datable to the early Tang (Chūgoku Sekkutsu, Tonkō Makkōkutsu, Vol.3, Pl.88) is close to the embroidery in scale and composition. The scene is painted on the north face of the pillar behind the main images, in the corridor at the back of the cave. Sākyamuni, clad in a red robe, stands between two Bodhisattvas, Avalokitesvara and Mahāsthāmaprāpta. His nimbus and mandorla have a broad edging of flames, and the outlines of cliffs and mountain peaks appear behind. There are no disciples, and three canopies rather than one complete the composition. The colours in the wall painting have suffered a good deal of abrasion and loss, so that a detailed comparison is not possible. As a general impression, however, the figure of Sākyamuni appears somewhat stiffer, the robe pulled up tightly under the right arm, crossing the chest almost horizontally rather than falling gracefully in a single curve from the left shoulder. In both figures the edges of the outer garment are seen to wave (revealing a lining of a different colour) across the chest, around the shoulder and upper left arm and as two wavy edges falling from the gathering in the Buddha’s left hand. The more schematic character of the wall painting can be judged in this last fall, since the waves are juxtaposed and mirror each other exactly, while in the embroidery each pursues its own rhythm, and the differences in the undulations help to reveal the shape of the figure. The schematic character of the wall painting is on the whole closer to the depiction of Sākyamuni in the Famous Buddhist Images painting than to the embroidery: note especially the way in which the upper edge of the robe is brought up close under the right arm, and the stiff waves of the edges of the robe. The same double lines are used, however, in both the silk painting and the embroidery to indicate drapery folds, so all three depictions have points in common. In the embroidery, frequent slight variations in colour enhance the liveliness already present in the initial outlines-each fold is narrowly outlined in blue, always following the underdrawing in ink, which is visible in every place where the threads are broken or missing.</p><p>Turning to the depiction of the facial features in the several figures of this embroidery, we can observe subtle variations here also. The elderly disciple on Buddha’s left has the most vigorous appearance, with blue outlines strongly accenting all the main lines and even outlining his teeth, and used in a regular vertical crosshatching of the eyebrow, indicated on the silk ground beneath by an area of ink wash. The iris of his eye is painted in black ink directly on the silk ground without any overlying embroidery. Of the face of his companion opposite, enough remains to show that he had smooth features: the iris is again rendered in black ink on the silk ground, but the eyebrow above is embroidered with long thin stitches of blue interspersed with others of the pale silvery silk used for the rest of the head, so that the eyebrow appears smooth and delicate. In the Bodhisattvas, the eyebrows are indicated by single blue arcs as are the inner upper edge of the orbit and the almond-shaped contour of the eye. The iris is painted in ink, not on the silk ground beneath, but on the embroidery. The nose is outlined with a single line of stitches once perhaps tinged with red but now faded to a very pale yellow, as have the lips.</p><p>Even greater care was taken with the countenance of the Buddha. His hair is of the deepest indigo, edged in the lighter blue that also outlines the face and models the ears. In the centre of the hair at the base of the usnisa, this same lighter blue frames a small circle of the exposed white silk ground representing a jewel. The slender, finely arched eyebrows are in a lighter shade than the indigo used for the hair. The eyes, outlined in blue, are filled with horizontal rows of chain stitch in a whiter silk than the rest of the face: against this the irises, painted in black ink directly on the silk ground, stand out clearly and indeed seem have been lightly padded from behind so as to appear slightly raised. The edges of the eye orbit, the whole of the nose, the mouth, complemented by associated modelling lines and chin line. Are all in a golden colour. For the rest of the face, the rows of stitches follow both the outer contours and the inner features, thus revealing the whole circle of the orbit merely through the arrangement of the stitches. The dramatic effect of the modelling must originally have been much strengthened by differences of colour: today many of these colours have greatly faded, while the blues of the indigo have remained strong since they were initially created by oxidation.</p><p>Although these subtleties only reveal themselves on close examination, they do account for the extraordinary presence of the figures, and testify to the early date of the whole composition. Only in the early and high Tang do we find such close and constant attention to details that constantly serve to enhance the movement and form of the figures. Details such as the hands of the two Bodhisattvas show great sensitivity: those of the Bodhisattva on Buddha’s right are in anjalimudrā, palms pressed together, but with the index of right hand just crooked behind the rest. On Buddha’s left, the Bodhisattva’s right hand is extended, palm outwards; the thumb is missing but the wrist is intact and completely relaxed. Wrist and fingers are again seen to perfection in the left hand: no opportunity to depict graceful movement has been lost. In all these details the embroidery has followed the original cartoon in ink, which set out even such minor details as the flowers and buds scattered by the heavenly beings above. It invites comparison with the most delicate of the early Tang wall paintings, such as the Bodhisattva as Guide of Souls in Cave 205 (Vol.2, text figure, p.302), or a donor in Cave 401 (Chūgoku Sekkutsu, Tonkō Makkōkutsu, Vol.3, Pl.7).</p><p>Such comparisons inviting an early date are confirmed when we examine the demure attitudes of the donors below: the ladies in high-waisted dresses, with shoulder shawls: the men with modest cap-ribbons falling naturally; while at the top the canopy is of the domed kind, with curved ribs and segments alternating in colour, that we have already seen in the Representations of Famous Buddhist Images (Vol.2, Fig.9).</p><p>As noted above, the panel, apart from the losses sustained through long storage in a folded state, is in an amazingly good state of repair. The edges on both sides have been well preserved, and very little, if any, of the top and bottom edges has been lost, other than perhaps a few centimetres of unembroidered space. The panel is made up of hemp cloth, now visible in many place, although this was originally entirely covered by thin silk of a balanced close weave. Although this silk has now largely perished, it can still be seen easily, particularly in the upper left corner. Both the thin silk ground and the hemp cloth support are in fact formed of three widths of material sewn together, the seams being completely hidden when beneath the embroidery, but now easily visible on the plain ground due to the better preservation of the silk along the edges of the seams. After the embroidery reached London, it was couched on a new linen backing and mounted on a stretcher as a panel. For many years it hung in a glazed frame on the landing of the North Staircase of the British Museum, protected by a curtain. When the upstairs galleries were renovated in 1971, a special case was prepared for it so that it is frequently on view at entrance to Oriental Gallery Ⅱ.</p><p>Close examination of the embroidery shows that the design was first drawn in outline in ink directly onto the silk ground. Following this preliminary drawing, the main contours were first worked, most of them in dark blue silk, in lines of split stitch. In some places, for example in the contours of the rock of the mountain and in some of the drapery of the Bodhisattva on the left, these outlines were done in brown instead of blue. After this each of the areas enclosed by the outlines was filled by closely packed soft unplied floss silk. Stein describes this as “worked solid in satin stitch, ”but it many perhaps be split stitch, with long over-lapping stitches to produce a satiny finish. In general these lines fill the area in the same way that a field many be ploughed, following the outer boundaries and gradually reducing the area left to be done. There are , however, a number of variations: in many places the outlines are dispensed with and, just as in kesi (kossu; 緙絹) weave, a consistent division produces a line within a single colour, as in the centre line of the breast of the Bodhisattva on the right. This technique is also used in conjunction with a change of colour, for instance on the breast of the Buddha himself; it is used again to mark the edges of the petals in the lotus pedestals, and of the floral motifs in the embroidered hems of the garments of the two Bodhisattvas. The rock structure of the Vulture Peak, in several colours, is distinguished both by outlines in blue or brown, and occasionally by setting the filling stitches at right angles in adjacent facets of the rock, giving a sharp variation in reflectance.</p><p>Within each area so filled, there are subtle variations in colour, as well as differences in the length of stitch and type of silk used. For most of the large areas, the silk used is a single, rather full, unplied floss silk, and the stitches are long, often between 8 and 10 mm in length, giving a satiny appearance. In many places, however, as it was worked behind the needle, the two strands of the silk lightly twisted together (within each strand the silk is of course untwisted): this can be seen for example in the blue rock. In places where the silk is finer, this twisting of the strands is correspondingly tighter, as can be seen in some areas of the Bodhisattvas’ robes. Sometimes the stitches were much shorter in order to give a different surface texture. The clearest example of this is in the stitch (still a split stitch but with short stitches instead of long ones) used for the Buddha’s extended right arm. Here a totally different effect is achieved since each line of split stitch, instead of being closely packed, is quite separate from its neighbours, leaving the underlying thin silk ground clearly visible. When the embroidery was new, this technique must have resulted in an enhanced luminosity of the forearm and hand, distinct from the golden colour of the upper arm and shoulder; indeed this is still true today. In the hand itself, the way in which the lines of stitches follow the curves of the fleshy parts of the palm and fingers can be seen directly in the plate (Pl.1-2). The outlines of this hand and of the arm right up to the shoulder are in a silk which today appears completely black, without a hint of blue.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，8世紀</p><p>敦煌出土</p><p>背襯麻布</p><p>高241.0cm 寬159.5cm</p><p>英國博物館,ch.00260</p><p>參見Figs.1，2</p><p>這幅刺繡作品色彩豐富，技藝精湛，是敦煌藏經洞出土的最優秀的作品之一。從刺繡的做工上說，可與奈良國立博物館藏（勸修寺舊藏）的《釋迦牟尼說法圖繡帳》 (見《日本佛教美術源流》，254頁)相媲美（該作品製作於8世紀，尺寸爲207×157cm）。大英博物館所藏的斯坦因收集品中，還有其他一些刺繡作品，但多是裝飾性的，而該作品則同其他絹繪淨土圖一樣氣勢壯觀。</p><p>此圖由五尊佛像構成，上部是華蓋和飛天，下部是衆多的供養人像。佛陀站立在青色華蓋遮敝的蓮華寶座上，扁桃形的身光環繞著身體與頭光等高。曼陀羅的背後有一座岩山，可以想見，這是《法華經》中所說的靈鷲山。佛陀偏袒右肩，右手垂直下放，左手執衣襟。這是所有靈鷲山釋迦牟尼說法圖中所共有的一種姿勢（參見卷1，圖22）。</p><p>該刺繡曾長期疊放在藏經洞中，所以兩尊菩薩的像有部分破損，幸運的是主尊釋迦牟尼保存完好，菩薩略有殘損，而破損最嚴重的是兩尊菩薩背後只露出半個身子的兩尊弟子的像。造成這種破損的原因，正如斯坦因在《西域》（Serindia，卷2，983頁）中分析的那樣，是在人們取下畫上的吊繩折疊存放時，這些部位正好處在折線上。在斯坦因發現它時，這些像就已幾乎散失，但通過殘存部分仍能辨別出這二尊弟子的容貌，也能確認他們的衣物本是連在突兀的斷崖上的。二尊菩薩基本保存完好，和二尊弟子一樣，斜向前方站立在蓮華座上。他們緊挨弟子站在前方，在圖中的位置比弟子略低。主尊周圍各尊佛像的這種佈局，與我們在雕像中所見到的各尊佛像的陳列方式一樣，顯現出一定的空間進深。從技術上說，用刺繡是很難表現出空間感和量感的，但是這副作品卻實現了這一點。這一特點有力地証明了該作品的製作爲初唐時期。因為在初唐時期，無論是繪畫還是雕刻，人們都越來越注重表現空間感和量感。</p><p>新德里國立博物館藏的《釋迦牟尼瑞像圖》（參見卷2，解說插圖，306頁）中也有用岩山做背景的釋迦牟尼獨尊像。雖然兩幅作品産生的年代和地點相差很遠，但可以推測，過去確實存在有一座雕像，《靈鷲山釋迦牟尼說法圖》中的釋迦牟尼就是依據這座雕像創作的。《瑞像圖》中的釋迦牟尼像雖然沒有直接摹寫石雕像，但在很多地方我們都能夠找到石雕像的影子。以岩山做背景的佛像，與其他諸像一樣，只使用墨線而無色彩。環繞佛像的背光，兩側爲豎立的直線，上端呈半圓形，項光被完全納入其中。這種背光的表現形式、釋迦牟尼右肩上方的小坐像，使人強烈地感到這幅作品是以石雕爲原型創作的。只有彩色的長長的火焰光越出了背光的界線，外側是墨線勾勒的彩色的靈鷲山岩石，這種表現手法正適合於該作品記錄瑞像的目的。</p><p>在敦煌壁畫中，初唐時期建造的第332窟（《中國石窟·敦煌莫高窟》卷3，圖88）的壁畫裏，也有與此非常相似的《靈鷲山釋迦牟尼說法圖》。該圖繪在洞內後方回廊部位的方柱北面，釋迦牟尼身裹紅色袈裟，兩側站立著觀音、勢至二尊菩薩。背光和項光附有寬大的火焰紋，背後用線描繪出了斷崖或山上裸露的岩石。畫中沒有弟子，只有三頂華蓋，而非完整構圖。壁畫的色彩漫漶、脫落嚴重，無法對細節部分進行比較和研究。</p><p>然而，此壁畫給人的整體印象是，釋迦牟尼的像比較生硬，通常從左肩用柔和的弧線來描繪的衣服，在此用斜線幾乎橫切前胸，看似牢牢夾在右腋下方。外衣的邊緣呈波浪狀（能看到襯裏的不同顔色）；外衣從胸前穿過，從肩繞至左上臂，集中到左手，再從左手處形成兩條紐帶垂落下來。這些細節與本圖中的佛像相同。比較雙方對最後紐帶部分的處理，可以看出壁畫相對顯得有些形式化。壁畫中，紐帶的波紋兩條兩條地整齊地並列在一起，而刺繡中二條紐帶則分別有著自己的運動節奏，呈現出不同的波浪起伏，這種處理方法有助於刻畫釋迦牟尼的形象。</p><p>從整體上看，與本圖的刺繡作品相比，此幅壁畫的形式化的表現方法，更接近於《釋迦牟尼瑞像圖》。特別是橫過前胸的衲衣上端被右腋牢牢夾住、衲衣邊緣的波浪起伏用直線生硬地勾畫，這些都很引人注目。而另一方面，絹繪的瑞像圖和本刺繡作品中，衣褶都用雙線表示，所以說三者之間存在共同點。刺繡作品中，僅有的幾種顔色變化頻繁，進一步增加了樣本已具有的生動感。袈裟則用藍色線沿著底稿的墨線細緻地刻畫，在那些絲線已斷裂、缺失的地方，我們還可以看到底稿的墨線。</p><p>再看諸佛的面容，其表現也有一些細微的變化。表情最爲生動的，是站在如來左邊的年老弟子，包括牙齒的輪廓線在內，主要線條均用藍色突出出來。眉毛是在絹底上用淡墨畫的，粗粗的，上用線繡出一些細毛。黑眼珠是在絹底上直接用墨描繪的，沒用刺繡。右側弟子面部雖然只殘留一小部分，但能看出他表情柔和。黑眼珠也是在絹底上用墨點出的，眉毛則使用藍色線，針腳細而長。臉部到頭部使用淡銀色線，幾種顔色搭配在一起，顯得柔和、細膩。</p><p>二菩薩的眉毛與眼窩線及杏核眼的輪廓，都使用了一根藍色的弧線來表示。而黑眼珠沒畫在絹底上，是用墨繪在了刺繡上。鼻梁線與嘴唇線使用了相同的顔色，當初可能是淡紅色，但現在已褪變爲黃色。</p><p>佛陀的面容更是下了許多功夫。頭髮是深藏青色，臉部、耳朵的輪廓線都使用了明快的藍色。頭髮中央的肉髻珠的位置，留出了圓形的白色絹底，周圍圈以明快的藍色，看似寶石。細細的眉毛呈優美的弧形，顏色與頭髮的深藏青色相比有淡淡的陰影。眼睛輪廓爲藍色，眼白則用比臉部還白的絹絲，採用鎖繡的手法水平刺繡而成。而黑眼珠則是在絹底上直接用墨描繪。黑眼珠具有鮮明的立體感，其實是在下面墊了東西使其稍稍凸出來一點。眼窩、鼻、唇、下顎以及裸露的身體，均使用金黃色。面部其他部分則分別沿著臉的輪廓線和五官的輪廓線刺繡而成，看起來像是打著漩兒。裸露的身體當初肯定有著強烈的色彩變化，但現在，大部分已褪色，只有深藏青色還殘留著它的鮮豔。</p><p>只有在對該作品進行仔細的研究之後，我們才能發現這些細節部分的精妙之處。這些細節不僅表現出其在佛像刻畫中的非凡之處，也證明了該作品本身的製作年代之早。因爲這種極其注重細節並以此提高佛像生動感的特色，只在初唐到盛唐間的作品中才能見得到。</p><p>再看二尊菩薩的手，我們會發現對細節部分的刻畫幾乎到了細緻入微的地步。如，合掌侍立在釋迦牟尼右側的菩薩，右手食指彎曲，藏在其他手指的陰影裏。侍立在左側的菩薩，右手伸開，掌心向外，拇指雖已殘缺，但手腕處保存完好，並表現出了柔弱無力的樣子。其左手的手腕和手指完整地保留至今，仍然優雅生動。這種細節是沿著底稿上的墨線用刺繡來刻畫的。圖上方飛天周圍散落的花朵、花蕾等細節的刻畫方法也與此相同。</p><p>綜上所述，和敦煌初唐時期的壁畫相比，該作品可以和第205窟西壁的《引路菩薩圖》（卷2，解說插圖，306頁）、第401窟的《供養菩薩圖》（《中國石窟·敦煌莫高窟》卷3，圖7）等最爲精緻的壁畫相媲美。</p><p>可與這些早期作品相媲美的地方，還有對圖下部供養人像文雅姿態的刻畫：女供養人在齊胸的裙子外披肩巾、男供養人柔軟垂落的襆頭等。另外，圓頂華蓋是通過表現不同的材料的交互將顔色分開，在《釋迦牟尼瑞像圖》（卷2，Fig.9）中也能見到這種表現方式。</p><p>前面已經介紹過，由於此作品被長時間折疊存放，除殘損部分外，其餘部分保存完好得令人驚訝。畫面的兩端都完好無損，上下邊即使是保存下來，也不過是數釐米沒有刺繡圖案的絹底。</p><p>此作品本來是在麻布上鋪了一層質地緻密的薄絹。薄絹已損壞相當嚴重，但畫面右上部的部分卻殘留了下來。整個作品是用三幅這種薄絹面和麻布裏重疊的布料縫合而成的，縫合的針眼本應是完全隱蔽在刺繡下面的，但現在，部分針眼在絹面上已經隨處可見。</p><p>此繡品運送到倫敦以後，被重新用麻布裱褙，變得象幅油畫一樣，還加上了玻璃鏡框。在很長一段時間裏，覆蓋著幕布挂在大英博物館北部樓梯的平臺上。到了1971年，博物館二層陳列室改建時，才被放進特製的匣子裏，擺放在東方繪畫陳列室入口處顯眼的地方。</p><p>仔細查看該作品，我們會發現其是先將底樣直接描繪在絹底上，然後照樣刺繡的。主線基本上是用深藏青色絲線割繡。但有一部分如裸露的山石、侍立右側的菩薩的袈裟等等，則用褐色取代了藏青色。然後用柔軟的單股絹絲認真填平用線圈起來的範圍，雖然斯坦因稱其爲緞繡，但從其長而平滑的針腳看，恐怕應是割繡。</p><p>一般來說，用刺繡填埋輪廓線內的空白，就像耕地一樣，沿輪廓線來回做往復運動，逐漸縮小空白部分。但在這裏，不只是用這種方法，而是産生了各種變化。不僅運用直線針，更多則採用織錦似的針法，如侍立左側的菩薩胸部的中線，就是在同種色線繡出的部位中加上非常明顯的分界線。此種手法，除了使釋迦牟尼胸部顔色更具變化外，也使蓮華座的花瓣兒更醒目、二尊菩薩的衣邊兒花紋爲更突出。背景中岩石臨接的地方使用相互垂直的針腳，表現出了岩石表面的凹凸不平。</p><p>在填埋各部分時，通過變換針腳的長短或所用絲線的種類來産生色彩的微妙變化。面積較大的部分則幾乎都是使用未撚的單股線，針腳有8－10mm，表面顯得很有光澤。但很多地方繡針在往返時使兩股線輕輕地撚在了一起（單股線不用撚）。這一特點在岩山的青色部分表現得非常明顯，而且在菩薩的衣裳上也是隨處可見，用細線繡的部分，線都撚在一起，非常細密。同時這些地方針腳較短，表面的感覺也略有不同。其中一個明顯的例子，就是釋迦牟尼伸向下方的右手，上下部分的繡法雖然相同，但針腳從上部到下部逐漸由長變短。並且，下部所繡的各線沒有緊密填補空間，針與針之間有距離，從隙間露出了薄絹底，産生出與上部完全不同的效果。</p><p>與我們今天所看到的情形不同，這幅作品在剛完成時，前臂和手掌因這種技法而産生了與金色的肩部和上臂部不同的效果，其亮度要更大一些。這種效果現在還沒有完全消失，從手部擴大圖（圖1－2）上可以看到，刺繡的線沿著手掌及手指的曲線描繪出不同的弧度。現在，其手的前部及手腕到肩等處的輪廓線變成了黑色，已看不出原來的藍色了。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription

A.D.</p><p>From Dunhuang</p><p>Fragment of silk embroidery</p><p>H. 11.0 cm, W. 6.6 cm</p><p>British Museum, MAS 911 (Ch. iv. 002)</p><p>Although diminutive in comparison with the large composition of the Vulture Peak (Pl. 1), this is a fine work. The Buddha, holding an alms bowl in his right hand, stands full-face. His left hand gathers up his robe with exactly the same gesture seen in the previous embroidery; the robe itself, however, is worked in oblong panels, and the underrobe in stripes, without attempting any elaborate curves. All the outlines –of the Buddha, the nimbus, the mandorla and the flames that surround it – were originally done in gold leaf, which was mounted on paper and cut into very narrow strips and then couched in yellow silk thread. These couching stitches now show up very clearly against the dark paper strips, the gold leaf having largely fallen away. Like other embroideries in this collection, this one is worked on a gauze, probably of complex alternating type (see Pls. 21-26 and Glossary of Textile Terms, p. 345), which is further backed with a very fine plain silk. There supports are both dark purple. Gauze was chosen as a backing probably because its complex structure and ability to stretch eliminated the danger of cutting threads in the support through repeated minute stitches. It also helps to give more substance to the motifs being executed; in fact the whole piece is so tightly packed with stitches that it is quite stiff to handle.</p><p>Another tiny embroidered Buddha, from Toyuk, was discovered by Le Coq and shown in New York in the 1982 exhibition Along the Ancient Silk Routes: Central Asian Art from the West Berlin State Museums, being dated eighth to ninth century A.D. in the catalogue (No. 144). Despite size and other points in common (such as the appearance of the hem of the robe as it crosses the shoulder and passes under the right arm, and the closely packed stitches which have been described as “totally cover [ing] the front and back of the fabric”), the Toyuk piece is less formal and hieratic than the one here; the stance is relaxed, and this is reflected in the folds of the robe, which are far more natural than the oblong panels in the Stein example. A piece of silk printed in the jiaxie technique is attached to the Toyuk Buddha, suggesting that it was one of several small Buddhas in the mandorla of a much larger figure. The Stein example may have served a similar purpose but is itself monumental in character despite its small size. The gold leaf of the paper strips, as well as the rich colour of the gauze beneath, must originally have given it added splendour.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，7～8世紀</p><p>敦煌出土</p><p>高11.0釐米 寬6.6釐米</p><p>大英博物館,MAS911(Ch.lv.002)</p><p>與上圖的大型作品《靈鷲山釋迦說法圖》（圖1）相比，雖然是極小的斷片，但卻是一件出色的作品。佛是右手持缽，正面而立。左手執襟和上圖的姿勢完全一樣。但是衲衣與上圖不同，由看似長方形紋樣連接而成，裏面是縞紋樣，完全看不出表現錯綜複雜曲線的意圖。佛和頭光、身光以及包圍它們的火焰光等的輪廓線所用的金葉，金裱在紙上，切成細絲，然後用黃色絹絲固定住。現在大部分金箔已剝落，黃色絹絲在發黑的紙的線上，清楚的浮現出來了。與其他刺繡品一樣，這個作品也繡在重疊著的薄絹（參見圖21～26，紡織品術語表，p. 345）和有眼平絹上。這兩片絹均是深胭脂色。製作刺繡時使用這種薄絹，可能是因結構複雜，並且有伸縮力，反復刺繡也不用擔心弄斷底線，也那可以有效地表現刺繡的厚重感。實際上，此斷片的刺繡密度很大，很結實。</p><p>除此以外，勒柯克在吐峪溝發現的小型刺繡佛立像，1982年在紐約作爲“古代絲綢之路：西柏林國立博物館收藏的中亞美術品”展示时的目錄(No. 144)中，年代記爲8－9世紀。尺寸及其他方面大致相同（例如：從左肩繞到右腋下的衲衣邊的樣子，以及解說中的“帛的裏和面全都覆蓋”的細密繡法等），但吐峪溝的宗教色彩遠比此斷片淡薄，形式也自由。其姿態也很舒展，在其衲衣的褶線上也有體現，與此作品長方形紋樣相比，自然得多。吐峪溝的立佛上有夾纈染的絲綢,暗示著這可能是配在大佛曼陀羅背光上的幾身小佛中的一身。相比之下，本圖的像雖然是小像，但起作用是相同的。當初金葉的金箔與薄絹的絢麗色彩相互輝映，其華麗的程度一定更突出。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n=" Vol. 3 Plate 3"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.857</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Embroidered panel with flowers and ducks</title><title lang="chi-Hant">綾地花鳥紋刺繡袋</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 8th century A.D.</p><p>From Dunhuang</p><p>Embroidery on silk damask backed with plain weave</p><p>H.92.0cm, W.24.0 cm</p><p>British Museum, MAS 857 (Ch. xxii. 0019)</p><p>See also Fig.3</p><p>When found, this panel was sewn in the form of an oblong cover, folded in half and joined along one edge and the two ends. It is embroidered on a white damask lined with plain white silk, and a selvedge is visible along one edge of both fabrics. The damask itself is in a floral design, although this is hard to see beneath the exuberant scrolling embroidered stems, leaves and flowers which are evenly disposed over the whole surface of the piece, with small ducks in flight between the stems. Apart from their eyes, beaks and wing-patches in silk, the birds are worked solid in plied silk thread rolled with strips of gold-leafed paper, the threads running in pairs and couched with fine silk. The stems, flowers and leaves are edged with a single thread similarly covered in silver-leafed paper, though this has mainly perished.</p><p>All these edges were applied as the finishing touch to the piece, after stems had been worked in split stitch and the leaves and petals had been filled in with satin stitch. In places where the indigo thread of the stems has been broken, one can still see faint traces of the ink used to outline the design. The use of the silk was very economical: often the stitches on the front are 8 or 9 mm long, and on the back barely 1 mm as the needle returns, splitting the silk, to go forward another long stitch on the front. The scrolling stems are all connected and begin in the middle on the selvedge side. Along the opposite side the design evidently continued, and there is every reason to suppose that it did so over a full width of silk, a width more than twice the present 24 cm. At the top and bottom, the stems and leaves conform with the straight line of the edge, so nothing has been lost there. The form in which it was discovered, as a bag or cover, must the have been a form of re-use, after part of the embroidery had been cut off.</p><p>Throughout, the work displays the qualities of Tang floral art at its best. In addition to the many variations of colour in the flowers, the leaves are worked in green and indigo to suggest twists and turns. For a denser treatment of the same foliage motif, one might instance the edges of the stele to the Chan Master of Great Wisdom, in the Beilin at Xi’an, which is dated the 24th year of Kaiyuan (A.D.736).</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，8世紀</p><p>敦煌出土</p><p>裏子爲平絹</p><p>高92.0釐米 寬24.0釐米</p><p>大英博物館,MAS857(Ch.xxii.0019)</p><p>參照Fig.3</p><p>發現當初，這是將長條布對折，縫合了三面的長方形袋子。白絹做裏子，在白綾上進行刺繡，一端能看到兩片絹的織邊。底子的綾也有花色圖案，被刺繡遮蓋在下邊，無法分辨。刺繡以唐草花紋爲主，配滿了花和葉子，花草叢中有看似鴛鴦的小鳥飛翔。小鳥除眼和嘴外，還有一部分翅膀使用絹絲，其餘全都是兩根並排的撚金葉，並用細絹絲做了固定。莖、花、葉子，脫落的部分也多是用一根銀葉鑲邊。</p><p>製作程序是先繡好莖，再用孺子繡繡葉子和花瓣，等所有的刺繡結束後再鑲邊。在紺色線刺繡的莖的損壞部分，仍然可以見到淺淺的底稿墨線。絹絲的使用很珍惜：正面常常是繡出8～9毫米長的刺繡針腳，在背面翻回僅有1毫米左右長，再在面上繡下個長針腳的方法。莖的曲線從織邊的中央部位開始，連成一枝。很明顯，此圖案在織邊的對側一面還有延續，可能原來是在比現在的24釐米的寬兩倍左右的整幅絹上進行的刺繡。上端和下端的莖和葉子沒有斷，所以沒有受到損傷。發現時，其形狀像袋子或套子，那可能斷開的是更大的一塊刺繡布料，被再利用而成的。</p><p>通盤考慮這件刺繡的圖案設計，完全展示了唐代達到最高峰時期的花紋風格。此外其上面的花有各種色彩變化，葉子是用綠色和深紺色表現纏繞或翻轉。同樣稠密的花紋還可舉出有開元二十四年（736年）的西安碑林之《大智禪師碑》的邊飾花紋。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n=" Vol. 3 Plate 4-1"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.912</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Two fragments with flowers and a deer</title><title lang="chi-Hant">羅地花文刺繡斷片、綾地花文刺繡斷片</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 8th-9th century A.D.</p><p>From Dunhuang</p><p>Silk embroidery</p><p>Left: 28.5×7.0 cm</p><p>Right: 14.0×6.0 cm</p><p>From left: MAS 912 (Ch. xxvi. 003), MAS 915 (Ch. 00347)</p><p>As with the small Buddha (Pl.2), the larger of these pieces of embroidery is on gauze, which in turn is backed with a fine silk, both originally pink.

This one, having been taken apart in the 1960s for study of the silk borders showing confronted animals, has been temporarily reassembled for the present plate, so the borders are slightly wider than they were originally. The wrapper is shown in its original state in Serindia, Pl. CXI. Another wrapper from Dunhuang, apparently made from the same elements, is in the Pelliot collection (EO. 1199; Tissus de Touen-houang, Pl. 39). In the same collection is another wrapper assembled in a similar way, but using a silk of a different pattern for the borders (EO. 1207; ibid., Pl. 43).</p><p>Because the cover has been taken apart, it seems appropriate to quote the description given in Serindia:</p><p>Silk MS roll-cover, Body made of rectang [ular] piece of plain pink silk, backed with coarse paper, and stiffened with wooden strainer at each end. All round a 2″ [5 cm] border of thick figured silk, and at one end are attached three broad bands of same –one in middle projecting c. 8″ [20 cm] beyond edge of cover, and one at each side of it converging to meet the first near its outer end. To either end of middle hand are sewn tapes of coarse linen for tying up cover when rolled round manuscript. Down main panel of plain silk, dividing it lengthways into three parts, are also sewn two strips of exceedingly fine silk tapestry, Panel lined with plain pale green silk, and the bands with greenish grey: on either side is stamped the Chin [ese] char [acter] 開 k’ai (‘open’).</p><p>The remainder of the description in Serindia is concerned with the figured silk of the border and bands, with its Sasanian pattern of large elliptical medallions with confronted animals, alternating with smaller panels between. The design as reconstructed in Serindia (Pl. CXⅥ) is shown in Fig. 7 of the monochrome plates in this volume. As in the similar silk shown in Pl. 40, the fabric is a compound weave (2/1 twill on one side and plain weave on the back) with a supplementary thread (double the normal weight) which elongates the pattern. The manner in which the pattern is created, with four colours worked at one time, accounts for the jerky, stepped outlines and the predominance of straight lines in the design.</p><p>This distinctive type of silk-compact, thick and heavy-has been extensively discussed by D.G. Shepherd and W. B. Henning (1959; pp. 15-40). The illustrations accompanying the article include all the known examples of the type, including important loom pieces that show the whole width of the silk with the selvedges intact. One of these, in the Collegiate Church of Notre Dame, Huy, Belgium, is 1.22 m wide and has four and a half rows each comprising three large-scale roundels with confronting rams. It is inscribed in ink with an inscription in Sogdian referring to “Long 61 spans ... Zandaniji.” This may refer to the town of Zandane near Bukhara, Sogdiana, which was famous for its fine cloth. Thus the whole group of silks might be identified as Sogdian, and roughly dated as belonging to the seventh century. The width of the fabric is much greater than that of most contemporary Chinese silks, and the selvedges are quite different in character, being cut as long fringes, having apparently passed round a strong tensioning cord when on the loom.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，8世紀</p><p>敦煌出土</p><p>絹、紙製</p><p>高78.6釐米,寬30.6釐米</p><p>大英博物館,MAS858(Ch.xlviii.001)</p><p>參照Figs.6、7</p><p>佛教經典大多都是由多卷經卷構成，爲了將其包紮成一捆而使用帙。本圖是其帙中的一例，下一圖將揭示另一類型的帙。此帙爲了研究邊絹上的面對面的動物圖案，曾於1960年代被拆開。這次拍攝此圖版時，將其恢復爲原來的狀態。邊緣部分比原來略寬了一點。此帙原來的面貌可見《西域》，參照圖版CXI。使用與此明顯相同材料的敦煌出土的經帙，伯希和收集品（EO. 1199;伯希和圖錄《敦煌的染織》，圖39）中也有。伯希和收集品中還有拼接方式相同，但邊絹的花紋與此不同的作品（EO. 1199;伯希和圖錄《敦煌的染織》，圖43）。</p><p>如果從該帙被拆開考慮，則在這裏原封不動的引用《西域》中的記述爲更合適。</p><p>“絹的經帙。完整。主體是淡紅色的長方形平絹製成，用粗質的紙做芯，兩端插入木籖增加強度。周圍有5cm寬的厚錦邊，另一端有用同樣的錦做的三條帶子。中間的帶子長約20cm，從主體部分伸出。其它兩條在兩側斜著交叉在離絹邊不太遠的中間帶子的一點上。中間帶子的兩端綴縫著粗麻布帶子，把經卷捲好後，可將其捆緊。主體的平絹部分，縫著從精致的織錦上細致裁下的絹條，將整體分成三個區域。豎布條用淡綠色的平絹做裏子，可見綠灰色的縞。兩面有用漢字寫的‘開’字。”</p><p>《西域》中除以上引用的部分，還有邊和帶子所用的錦的記載。此錦上，有橢圓形中兩頭面對面動物的波斯風格的薩珊朝圖案，還有交錯的菱形花紋。其設計的復原圖刊登在《西域》（圖CXVI）中，參照Fig. 7。見於本書圖40的同種錦，是用經線和緯線織出的紋樣（面爲三片綾，裏爲平絹），利用暗線（一般重量的二倍）不使紋樣的圖案中斷。這種技法可同時用四色線織出紋樣，但是紋樣的線不是直線，不圓滑。</p><p>關於厚而重的特殊錦，D.G.

The wrapper is made of bamboo splints held together by bands of silk decoration formed by twined silk. There are three more wrappers from Dunhuang in the Pelliot collection in Paris (Tissus de Touen-houang, Pls. 1,3 and 4). Other better-preserved wrappers of similar construction are in the Shoso-in Treasure House at Nara (Treasures of the Shoso-in, Middle Section, Pls. 27-31). Some of these are very much more elaborate in their decoration, as is appropriate to their original purpose, but all are similar in size, in the principles of their decoration and even in some of the motifs.</p><p>In all of these, the construction is similar, with a weft of split bamboo, and they were probably woven by exactly the same method still employed in Japan for the construction of screens for papermaking.1 The warp threads are in pairs of different colours, twined with a Z-twist. Tension on the back brings one colour or the other of each pair forward as needed to form the pattern. The index character yin 陰 near the edge is formed separately by twining two threads of different colours back and forth, over the free ends of the bamboo splints.2 Finally, the edges were protected by a further pair of twined threads and by binding the edges with paper, fragments of which remain attached to the bamboo splints.</p><p>These features can be better seen on the examples in Paris. The whole of the back was also lined with paper. The decoration consisted of variations on the baoxiang, or precious-flower motifs, between broad and narrow bands, the wider bands being between 23 and 25 mm wide, and the narrower ones between 8 and 10 mm. The bamboo weft is visible in the spaces between. The same arrangement can be seen in one of the Shoso-in examples (ibid., Pl. 29),which has also lost its lining cloth and border of brocade. Another Shoso-in wrapper has stripes of even width (ibid., Pl. 28). On a third (ibid., Pl. 31), the decoration is basically organized in stripes, but the weaving entirely covers the bamboo weft. In the most elaborate of the Shoso-in examples (ibid., Pl. 27), two colours only, purple and white, are used to form a large design centering on two medallions, each with a kalavinka at the centre, surrounded by a grapevine scroll, outside which is the text of an Imperial order for the distribution of the Suvarnaprabhasa- sutra to official state monasteries dated the 14 th year of Tempyo (A.D. 742). The whole of the design, including the characters of the inscription, is formed by bringing one or the other colour forward. From these examples in the Shoso-in we can see that the edges of such sutra wrappers were commonly protected with a brocade binding and that they were fastened by a central tape of the same, with diagonal braces. It is interesting to note that, on a humbler scale, wrappers woven from split bamboo are still associated with writing today in East Asia, being used to hold writing brushes.</p><p>1 The photographs (from Sukey Hughes, Washi: The World of Japanese Paper, Tokyo, 1978, Pls. 235-36) show how the bamboo splints are added working upwards and how the threads are individually tensioned.</p><p>2 In the case of one of the Pelliot wrappers (EO.1200), it has been suggested that the creation of the inscription was a veritable “tour de force,” since the bamboo weft had to be already in place (Tissus de Touen-houang, p. 5). However, since the ends were open, the operation as described here was actually quite simple.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，7～8世紀</p><p>敦煌出土</p><p>竹、絹</p><p>高43.0釐米 寬26.8釐米</p><p>MAS859(Ch.xx.006)</p><p>与上圖的經帙相同，用於包裹若干卷子做保護。此經帙是將削好的細竹用絹絲編織而成，絹絲部分成了帶狀的裝飾。在巴黎伯希和收集品中，從敦煌攜來的此種經帙有三件（參照伯希和圖錄《敦煌的染織》圖版1、2、3），奈良正倉院也收藏有同樣製作的經帙，保存狀態更好（參照《正倉院寶物 中倉》圖版27～31）。這些中的幾件不仅適應當時的使用目的，又有格外精美的裝飾。不過它們所有的尺寸和基本裝飾都大致相同，甚至部分紋樣也有共同點。</p><p>以上所列舉的，在製作方面也很相似，採用了竹籤充當緯線的相同編法。它們與日本直到現在編織用於漉紙的漉簀所使用的方法相同。經線變色的部分成Z狀扭曲，從背面拉拽調整，顔色或出現在表面上，或出現在相反位置上，從而産生紋樣。一端上側所見到的“陰”字，與纹樣部分不同，是兩色合起來撚成的線織出來的。兩端安有寬的竹片，夾上紙，用上邊的每兩股撚成的線來固定，一部分紙仍保留至今。</p><p>此件比巴黎的特徵更明顯，其背面全用紙裱糊了。紋樣從寬到窄，各不相同，但無論哪一種都是寶相花紋樣的變形，寬的有23－25毫米，窄的也有8－10毫米。這些紋樣帶之間，竹籤充當緯線。與此完全相同結構的也見於正倉院寶物（上揭書，圖版29）的一件作品上，但裏子的布和錦邊飾等也都佚失。正倉院的其他經帙（上揭書，圖版28），紋樣帶寬度都較均勻。第三個（上揭書，圖版31），基本裝飾是縞紋樣，充當緯線的竹子全用線纏著。正倉院中最爲漂亮的（上揭書，圖版27），是中央配有迦陵頻伽，周圍環繞著只用紫和白色表現的兩個大的葡萄唐草的圓形花紋。此紋樣的外側，一邊繡著“依天平十四年（742年）歲在壬午春二月十四日敕”，另一邊繡著“天下諸國每塔安置金字金光明最勝王經”的文字（此紀年與其他史書所記載的天平十三年的紀年不一致）。包括此題記部分，整體圖案都是由兩種顔色對比構成的。看這些正倉院的諸例子，與在這裏所展示的經帙，原來也和上圖的作品一樣，通常是用錦做邊，中央部位的系帶也是相同的錦帶。而非常有趣的是，尺寸稍小，但與它們一樣用線編的竹籤，至今在東亞各國仍將其作爲捆捲毛筆的工具。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n=" Vol. 3 Plate 8"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.855</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Altar valance (detail)</title><title lang="chi-Hant">聖壇垂幕（局部）</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 8th-9th century A.D.</p><p>From Dunhuang</p><p>Silk</p><p>H. 51.0 cm, W.183.0 cm</p><p>MAS 855 (Ch. 00279)</p><p>See also Figs. 4,5</p><p>The survival of something once commonplace in the Buddhist temples of China and now so rare as this altar valance testifies to the wide range of the objects preserved in the sealed library of Cave 17 at Dunhuang. Of the three valances found by Stein there, this is the most complete; the other two are now in New Delhi. Painted representations of valances are extremely common among the wall paintings, and there are some handsome examples among the silk paintings as well, notably the top edge of the Paradise of Sakyamuni (Vol.1, Pl. 8-2). The basic elements of that painted valance are essentially the same as those of the one shown here: a broad top border, there of plain red silk, with an elaborate floral design, and hanging from this border a row of triangular elements, from which in the painting long tassels and small tabs hang in regular alternation. In the textile presented here, the row of triangular pieces of cloth is actually double. At their points hang little tabs or rosettes, while longer tassels hang from behind. Some of these long tassels are made of a single piece of material, often striking in colour or decoration, while others are made up of overlapping points of silk in different colours. Both the textile valance and the painted one contain white streamers tied with a symmetrical double bow. The little tabs are stuffed with small pieces of silk, and three of them take the form of human figures, one a female with a face of white damask and with features indicated in apricot silk. Behind all the hanging elements is a curtain made up of larger pieces of plain silk.</p><p>There are over seventy pieces of material in all (see the sketch and enumeration of the component parts, Fig.5), comprising most of the varieties of fabrics represented in the Stein Collection, and at least one piece, of a ribbed silk, which is not otherwise represented. Though the valance is a rich source of information on the types of textile to be found at Dunhuang, its main value is as a complete assembly (only a few streamers at the right-hand end are missing), showing how every scrap of silk was saved and put to use as a furnishing for an altar or a canopy in one of the temples or caves.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，8～9世紀</p><p>敦煌出土</p><p>高51.0釐米 全長183.0釐米</p><p>MAS855(Ch.00279)</p><p>參照Figs.4、5</p><p>像这样的垂幕應該是在中國古代佛教寺院中最普通的，而現在卻极缺乏样例，這一例只能說明敦煌第17窟藏經洞收藏的物品之廣泛。斯坦因帶回的三件，這件保存狀態最爲完整，其他兩件為新德里國立博物館收藏。壁畫中多見描繪這種垂幕的範例，另外在絹繪作品中也有幾件精美的例子。在那些之中，特別引人注目的是《報恩經變相圖》畫面上端描繪的垂幕（第1卷圖8），其基本结构與本圖的垂幕大致相同：那繪畫上端的寬橫帶，是在淡綠色平絹上繪着美麗花紋，從橫帶垂落的三角形的裝飾，还有長穗飾和小玉飾從這裏交錯而有规律的垂下。本織品三角形的裝飾是兩層的，其中幾個上面還綴著小飾物。然后再從那後面垂下幾條很長的裝飾布，其多数爲一塊布做成，色彩和裝飾對比強烈。還可見與此不同的是各種色絹重疊在一起的布條。另外，無論是此實物垂幕還是繪畫中的垂幕，都有白色的蝴蝶結垂飾。小飾物是內塞滿小絹布而成，有三個是人形，其中一個臉部用白綾，眼睛和鼻子是紅色絹絲作成的女性形象。所有垂饰背後，有很大的平絹布做的幕。</p><p>此垂幕是由七十多塊小片組成的（從素描和结构一覽表看，Fig.5），是斯坦因收集的染織品中最富變化的。斯坦因的收集品中，除此件外，至少還有一件本書未採用的棱形垂幕。根据那些垂幕，可以獲得有關敦煌出土的各類染織品的豐富線索，然而無論怎么说，其真正價值在於作爲完整的作品被保留下來這一點上（只是右端部分的飾物佚失幾件），可以看出是如何收集小片的絹，把它們缝合起來，用於寺院或石窟的祭壇以及華蓋装饰的。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n=" Vol. 3 Plate 9"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.856</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Patchwork, probably a kasāya</title><title lang="chi-Hant">縫綴品，或為袈裟</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 8th-9th century A.D.</p><p>From Dunhuang</p><p>Silk</p><p>H.107.0cm, W.149.0cm</p><p>British Museum, MAS 856 (Ch.lv.0028)</p><p>See also Fig.8</p><p>Like the valance shown in the previous plate, this textile is an assemblage of many different fabrics, and a rare example of a once familiar type. Stein called it a “votive patchwork, ” and at first sight it appears suited to serve as an altar cloth, especially because of the symmetrical placing of the two embroidered flowers. But this symmetry has a more likely explanation, which was first suggested to me by Alan Kennedy . The two flowers form part of a regular pattern of patches, organised in seven vertical columns, and surrounded by a border with mitred corners. Such an arrangement is consistent with the prescribed form for a kasāya, or Buddhist monastic patchwork robe, which might have any odd number of columns, from five to twenty-three.</p><p>Because of the size of the whole patchwork and the fragmentary state of some of the fabrics, it is not possible to reproduce in detail more than a selection of the better-preserved pieces. The various fabrics are numbered according to Stein’s drawing, and the reader is referred to the description in Serindia (Vol.Ⅱ, pp.1069-70); points of difference are also noted below.</p><p>1. (Pl.9-6) This is a warp-faced compound double weave, with a 3/1 satin twill on the front, and plain weave on the back, very fine and close. Several pieces, symmetrically disposed with respect to the two embroidered flower motifs, appear in the patchwork.</p><p>2. (Pl.9-3) This is one of four pieces. No selvedge is visible, but the piece appears to be a weft-faced weave. The pattern is of four-petalled rosettes surrounded by small trefoils. In alternate rows the rosettes seem to have been originally a rosy pink; in the other rows they appear the same buff, almost golden, colour as the trefoils.</p><p>3. This is 4/1 twill, patterned in the same very fine and close weave. When examining the several pieces of this fabric with Mary Clare Clark, we came to the conclusion that the bands of colour are in the warp, with supplementary warp threads to create the petals, flowers and leaves of the patterns. According to Stein, the opposite is the case, with the warp in fine buff, slightly stiffened, and the weft of white, brown, dark and pale blue, tomato red, light and myrtle green, running in bands across the fabric, so that each band was completed before the next was begun. In our opinion, this might account for the fact that it is not possible to recover the complete scheme of the design from the surviving three fragments, since the weaver could change the order in which the different designs appeared and vary the colour combinations. Apart from the narrower bands and those with small motifs, two bands are prominent: one with small rosettes each flanked by a pair of leaves above and below, and one of large rosettes. Both bands are found with different colour combinations, in each case about 8.5 cm apart, suggesting a repeat at intervals of 17 cm.</p><p>4. Stein noted that the design of this silk is almost effaced, “but apparently consisted of running stems forming crescent-shaped loops with flowers at tips, and detached pair of outspread leaves above each flower. ”The front is in 3/1 twill, and the back appears to be plain weave. There are no supplementary threads to elongate the pattern.</p><p>5. This silk, although much damaged and originally consisting of several small pieces, is a double cloth (see p. 347, Glossary of Textile Terms, and the notes to Pl.37), combining double warp and double weft (each of a very fine and broad soft yarn), of which only the latter shows on the surface.</p><p>6. Compound warp-faced weave, with the front in 3/1 twill and the back in plain weave. The piece is divided into two small fragments, best described by Stein (Serindia, Vol.Ⅱ, p.1069): “Larger shows part of large rosette band, dark blue on scarlet ground (faded) with dark blue trefoils and quatrefoils, and foliage in light green above and below. Smaller shows lower edge of band of large green rosettes with green trefoils in spandrels; below these white horizontal trefoils, and below them pair of confronting ducks admirably executed. Yellow heads, necks, and curling wing tips, white breasts, blue backs, green beaks and tails, red eyes. Alternating with trefoil and duck groups are elliptical white rosettes. ”These ducks, each only some 8 mm long, are exactly as Stein describes them, but unfortunately are folded under the edge of the fragment, and so are not visible in the plate.</p><p>7. (Pl.9-7, central band) This is very similar to the preceding fabric, being a compound warp-faced weave, with plain weave on the back.</p><p>8. (Pl.9-7, upper band) This appears to be a weft-faced plain weave passing over two supplementary warp threads, giving it the appearance of a twill. It is therefore different from numbers 6 and 7, although Stein thought that the design was the same as in these. The design, on an indigo ground, is a very beautiful one, with rows of six-petalled rosettes set diagonally. Above each rosette (to the right in the plate) is a mass of foliage, forming part of a zig-zag band with upward-and downward-pointing trefoils at the points. In the middle of the foliage above each rosette is a pair of confronting ducks, standing with raised wings. One duck can be clearly seen in the plate, at right angles to the edge.</p><p>9. (Pl.9-7, lower band of zig-zag design) This is a compound fabric, with a twill on the front and plain weave on the back, apparently woven, as Stein noted, in imitation of a braid.</p><p>10. (Pls.9-2, 9-4) Like other embroideries in the collection (Pls.2 and 5), these two panels were originally faced with a gauze, whose lozenge pattern is still quite visible in the places where it has not fallen away. Plate 9-2 shows this gauze best. The gauze was not “purposely cut away round [the] design after [the] embroidery was completed, ”as Stein thought.</p><p>11. Symmetrically arranged on either side of the two flowers just described-in the centre, and at the corners-are several pieces of this embroidery of flowers, long-tailed blue-winged birds, and butterflies. The embroidery is on a red silk gauze backed with red silk, but here too most of the gauze has fallen away between the embroidered motifs.</p><p>12. These two panels towards the rear are themselves composed of lines of smaller patches, mainly in damask weave in yellow, red and purple. Because of their small size, the designs, in twill on a plain ground, can only be discerned in part. One of the panels also contains two small patches of weft-faced silk.</p><p>The presence of the purple silk, clearly available only in tiny pieces and most precious, suggests that the wearer of this robe was a monk of high rank: we should recall that Hongbian, chief of monks in Hexi, who was commemorated in the small cave where all these textiles were found, was accorded the right to wear purple by the Emperor when Chinese rule was restored in the Dunhuang area. Small pieces of purple silk were also found inside his statue, and a comparison might be interesting.</p><p>13,14. These, together with a piece of yellow silk in plain weave, are here used as backing for the central panel of embroidery. Both are damasks, one slate blue and the other wine red, with patterns of lozenge-shaped rosettes and small lozenges, respectively.</p><p>15. (Pl.9-5) Along the rear of the patchwork is a broad band of exceedingly coarse silk, printed in the jiaxie technique with large brown rosettes, in the middle of which are crimson spots. Similar designs, as Stein observed, can be found among the figured silks, cf.Pl.41-6.</p><p>16. (Border; Pls.9-1, 9-5) Around the whole patchwork is a border printed in jiaxie technique with twining stems and open flowers, repaired in places with another similar fabric.</p><p>If this once magnificent and still splendid patchwork is indeed a kasāya, or Buddhist monastic robe, worn by a high-ranking monk, it is another instance of the comprehensive range of finds from the sealed library which shed light on so many facets of Buddhist life at Dunhuang.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，8-9世紀</p><p>敦煌出土</p><p>絲綢</p><p>高107.0cm，寬149.0cm</p><p>大英博物館,MAS856(Ch.lv.0028)</p><p>MAS856(Ch.lv.0028)</p><p>與上圖中的垂幕一樣，這種紡織品數量大但質地各不相同，很少能發現相同的例子。斯坦因稱其爲 “縫綴的供品”，乍看上去像祭壇上鋪設的桌布。尤其兩處左右對稱的繡花，更是讓人産生這種看法。但這裏我們還看到配有左右對稱的布。關於這一點，有另外一種更有說服力的解釋，我從Alan Kennedy處第一次聽到這種說法。即該縫綴品是將七塊各色布片整齊地豎向拼接在一起，而繡花的那兩塊布，也是其中的一部分。在縫綴品的四周均縫有斜角接縫。袈裟通常是由五至二十三條奇數條構成，這種結構符合袈裟的規制。</p><p>由於袈裟非常大，且殘損的部分較多，在製作圖錄時，只能儘量多採用保存狀態較好的部分。對各個部分的說明是按照斯坦因的圖解序號展開的，請參照《西域》（卷2，1069-1070頁）中斯坦因的解說，在不同觀點之處加上註釋。</p><p>1、（圖9-6）這是經錦，表面是四枚綾紋，背面是細密的平織。這件袈裟上除了兩片繡有花紋外，還有多處是左右對稱的同樣的布。</p><p>2、（圖9-3）同樣的布料有四塊，這是其中的一塊。沒有布邊，看來像是緯錦。花紋是四瓣花，周圍環繞著小小的三片葉子的圖案。此花紋本來每隔一段距離就呈現出近似赤色的淡紅色，另外一段和楓葉紋的相同，是幾乎接近金色的淡黃色。</p><p>3、這是斜紋織物的四分之一，具有相同條紋花樣、紋路極其細密的斜紋錦。在我與Mary Clare Clark一起調查該作品的幾塊殘片時，我們曾提出豎條紋是由經線織成的，而花紋中的花、花瓣、葉等是由整經織成的。但斯坦因的看法與此相反，他認爲淡黃色是細的經線，而白色、茶色、深藏青色、淡青色、紅色、淡綠色、青綠色等豎條紋是緯線分別織成的。之所以會出現這種意見分歧，是因爲僅以現存的三塊殘片，根本無法捕捉織者按自己的意願自由變換花樣、順序和顔色組合而成的整個圖案的構思。如果將細條紋和細花紋區分開來，則帶花紋的主要有兩種。一種花紋是上下都配有一片葉子的小花，另一種則花稍大些，但沒有葉子。兩種花紋變換著組合，間隔大約爲8.5cm。因此，可以想像，每隔17cm，相同的花紋就會重復出現。</p><p>4、在斯坦因開始調查時，這種花樣的織錦幾乎已經失傳，“彎曲的莖呈月牙形，莖的頂端配有花，花上有向外伸展的一對葉”。正面是四枚紋綾，背面爲平織。</p><p>5、原本就是由雙層小布片縫成，加之破損又非常嚴重（見p.347，紡織品詞彙表及圖37注）。此布片使用了有光澤的單絲線，經線和緯線均爲兩組顔色，正面雙色交替。</p><p>6、此部分由二枚小布片組成，正面爲四枚綾紋，背面爲平織的經錦。斯坦因對這兩枚布片均有詳細的說明（《西域》卷2，1069頁）：“較大的那塊布片,在已褪色的紅色底色上，配有深藏青色的花和三葉或四葉紋，上下配有帶淡綠色葉子的花紋帶。較小的那塊，綠色大花紋帶的下邊有綠色三葉花紋。其下面還有白色的水平的三葉紋和一對鴨。鴨子黃色的頭、頸，捲曲的羽毛，白色的胸，藍色的背，綠色的嘴和尾，紅色的眼睛還能辨認得出。三葉與鴨固定搭配的是橢圓形的白花紋交替出現。”斯坦因描述說，鴨子大小只有8mm。遺憾的是，由於其一端被折了起來，所以從圖錄上無法辨認。</p><p>7、（圖9-7，中間帶狀部分）此片是與6大致相同的經錦，背面爲平織。</p><p>8、（圖9-7，上端帶狀部分）此片乍看像綾，實際上是平地的緯錦。因此斯坦因認爲其設計圖案與6和7相同。但實際上並不相同。此片的花紋浮現在深藏青色的地上，很美。六瓣花紋斜向排列，花紋周圍布有鋸齒狀的小葉紋。花紋與花紋之間有一對展翅的鴨，其中一隻在圖錄上也清晰可見。</p><p>9、（圖9-7，下方鋸齒紋帶）這是混合織品，正面爲綾，背面爲平織的錦。正如斯坦因所描述的那樣，顯然這是模仿手編織法。</p><p>10、（圖9-2，9-4）與斯坦因藏品中其他的刺繡斷片一樣（圖2，5），繡有花的這兩片，當初表面上也蒙了一層紗，今天我們還能清楚地看到，在殘存下來的紗上殘留著花紋。尤其圖9-2中的紗至今仍保存完好。斯坦因曾認爲“紗是在刺繡工作結束後，要從圖案的周圍裁切掉的東西。”其實並非如此。</p><p>11、此片上繡有長著藍色長尾羽的鳥、花和蝴蝶，其左右對稱地分佈在10中所述的繡花的兩側，此外在中間部位和後方的兩側等處，還可看到數處刺繡的殘片。刺繡是繡在用紅色的絹做裏襯的紅色紗上，但如前所述，其表面上的紗幾乎已經完全脫落了。</p><p>12、放在後面的這兩塊裝飾布，其本身就是由黃、紅、紫三種顔色的小塊綾縫綴而成的。雖然是小塊的綾，但在平底上用綾的織法織出的花紋，有很大一部分還是清晰可見的。在一塊裝飾布上，還縫入了兩小塊緯錦。</p><p>此外，雖然布塊很小，但是其中含有兩塊昂貴的紫色綾，所以可以認爲這件袈裟是高僧專用的，而這位高僧有可能是洪辨，他曾經是河西佛教領袖。藏有這些染織品的藏經洞就是爲了紀念他而修建的。而且在唐朝從吐蕃手中奪回敦煌地區時，皇帝曾恩賜他有穿著紫衣的資格。在他的塑像內部還發現了紫色絹片。將這些情況與這件縫綴的作品對照起來，這一推論是否合理就變得非常清楚了。</p><p>13、14、這些絹是平地的黃色絹，被用於袈裟中部刺繡的襯裏。一爲灰藍色，一爲赤紫色，均爲織有大小橢圓形花紋的綾。</p><p>15、（圖9-5）縫綴物後面有一帶狀粗絹。中間用夾纈技術染深紅點的棕色大花紋。正如斯坦因所指出的那樣，相同的圖案也出現在錦的斷片，例如圖41-6上。</p><p>16、（邊絹，圖9-1，9-5）。這是圍在縫綴物周邊的絹，上有用夾纈技術染的彎曲的莖和花。破損部位的修補也使用了相同的絹片。</p><p>如果將這件曾經是非常華麗的現在依然是絢麗多彩的縫綴物，看作是一位高僧的袈裟，則會使那些反映敦煌佛教徒方方面面生活的藏經洞遺品又增添了嶄新的意義。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n=" Vol. 3 Plate 10"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.860</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Banner with coloured panels</title><title lang="chi-Hant">彩絹幡</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 8th – 9th century A.D.</p><p>From Dunhuang</p><p>Silk</p><p>L.131.1 cm</p><p>British Museum, MAS 860 (Ch. i. 0011)</p><p>This, like the painted banners shown in Vol. 1, Pl. 28, is preserved complete, from the suspension loop at the top to the painted weighting board at the bottom. The construction is identical to the painted banners, except that here two additional bamboo splints are inserted at the joins between the coloured panels. Clearly the sequence of colours-blue, white and red (repeated in the companion banner shown in the next plate)-must have had its significance, but I am not able to explain this. The headpiece (Pl. 10-2) is a confection of a variety of handsome fabrics. One border is, as Stein described it, “of fine plain plum-coloured silk, calendered on [the] outside,” the other is a green damask with a lozenge pattern. The two large pieces in the centre, one of them showing an eagle with wings outspread, are both weft-faced silks. The streamer hanging at the left includes a piece of glazed silk. The three tail streamers are joined at the top and bottom, having been cut from a single piece of silk, the cut edges rolled and sewn to prevent fraying. The side streamers are attached so as to partly cover the three main panels when the banner is viewed from the front. This effect is lost when viewed from the back, but otherwise the appearance is virtually the same, the weighting board being painted on both sides: the weft-faced silk in the headpiece, the design of which can only be properly seen from the one side, indicates the front.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，8～9世紀</p><p>敦煌出土</p><p>長131.1釐米</p><p>大英博物館,MAS860(Ch.i.0011)</p><p>此幡與第1卷圖28的絹繪幡相同，從上端的吊環到幡畫下端的鎮板，所有的部位都完整地保留下來。構造方面，本圖幡的彩絹的連接處插了竹籖，除了其數量比絹繪的幡多出兩根這一點不同外，其他方面完全一樣。幡身青、白、紅色的順序（也在與此幡是一對的下圖幡中重復著），無疑有某種意義，但我無法解釋。幡頭（圖10－2）是用美麗的織物拼接而成。正斯坦因所說，一端的邊是“有光澤的紫色精美平絹”，另一端是加了菱形織紋的綠色綾。中央部分是兩塊布料拼合的，其中一塊上可見展翅的鷹，兩塊都是緯錦。側面幡尾中的左側也有一部分使用了有光澤的絹。幡腳是在一塊絹上做出切口，使之成爲三根，上下端仍連接在一起，爲了不使切口脫線，鎖了邊。兩側的幡尾，從幡的正面看，略微遮擋幡身。這種效果從背面看不出，而其他特點從背面看是一樣的。鎮板的兩面上都有彩繪，但幡頭緯錦上的圖案，只能從一側看到，它是幡正面的標誌。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n=" Vol. 3 Plate 11"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.861</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Banner with coloured panels</title><title lang="chi-Hant">彩絹幡</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 8th – 9th century A.D.</p><p>From Dunhuang</p><p>Silk</p><p>L.129.5 cm</p><p>MAS 861 (Ch. i. 0020)</p><p>This banner is a companion piece to the last.

Like the two preceding banners, it is made up of panels of silk, without a painted representation. Some of the banners had tail streamers of dark brown silk. The headpiece and one of the panels are of printed silk, but there are differences between them, in spite of the similarity of their motifs. The headpiece is made of a folded square of plain white silk with large squared flowers based on a central four-petalled floret, surrounded by three ranks of florets, each with three visible petals. The whole motif is quite large, nearly 14 cm square. Its irregular disposition over the silk and the fact that the ground is not coloured tempt me to suggest that each motif was separately printed. All the petals would first have been printed in indigo blue; a second block produced the yellow centers for the central floret for the outer row of florets, and for two florets on each side in the middle row, at the same time making their petals green; finally, touches of red were printed on top of the yellow and in the centres of the remaining eight florets. This red was rather fugitive and only pale traces of it remain. The same technique seems to have been used for the border seen in Pl. 16.</p><p>In the printed panel, the pattern is made up of squared florets, each with a cruciform flower at the centre. Because these motifs are reserved on a rose ground, it is hard to see how they could have been individually printed, and this suggests that the jiaxie technique (see Pls. 13-20) may have been used.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，8～9世紀</p><p>敦煌出土</p><p>絹</p><p>長130.5釐米 寬26.0～26.2釐米</p><p>MAS886(Ch.00360.a)</p><p>此幡是圖案基本相同，或完整或斷片的七件幡之一（其他的沒有收藏在大英博物館）。和上兩圖的幡一樣，幡身由絹拼接而成，沒有繪畫。七件中，有幾件上帶有深褐色絹的幡腳。另外，每件的幡頭和幡身的面使用著印花絹，图案相似，實際的紋樣卻稍有差別。幡頭是將方形纹樣的印花絹對折而成，其紋樣構成，是以中央四瓣的小花，周圍配方形排列的三層三瓣花。這是最大的圖案，是邊長14釐米左右的方形。對絹沒有規律的處理，底沒有染色，使我產生了每個圖案是分別印染的。染色時，首先，是將所有花瓣都染成藍色，接下來是將中央的花芯和外側行中的花芯以及正中各行的每兩個花芯染成黃色，同時，把正中間行的花瓣上也加黃色成爲綠色。最後，黃色上加紅色筆道，剩下的八個小花中心也加了紅色。這種紅易褪色，只留下淡淡的痕迹。圖16展示的絹繪的邊絹，可能也用了與此相同的技法。</p><p>幡身使用的印花絹的紋樣，是中央配飾十字形小花。這種圖案是在玫瑰紅底子上充分印染，很難判別其各個顔色是如何染上的。可能是使用了夾纈（參照圖13～20）的技法。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n=" Vol. 3 Plate 13-1"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.874.b</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Banner fragments with deer medallions</title><title lang="chi-Hant">平絹地鹿纹夾纈斷片（絹幡斷片）</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 8th – 9th century A.D.</p><p>From Dunhuang</p><p>Silk printed in jiaxie technique</p><p>13-1:28.5×10.7 cm</p><p>13-2:30.4×17.0 cm</p><p>13-3:28.5×28.0 cm</p><p>13-1: MAS 874.b (Ch. 00291)</p><p>13-2: MAS 874.a (Ch. 00291)</p><p>13-3: MAS 875 (Ch. 00292)</p><p>See also Fig. 9</p><p>When found by Stein, and as described in Serindia, the two larger fragments (Pls. 13-1,13-2) formed the first section of a banner of four sections with bamboo stiffeners at the junctions of each (similar to the banners in Pls. 10-12).

It was originally attached to a second panel of plain red silk of the same dimensions, sewn above it. If there were originally four panels, the body of the banner, with the headpiece, would have been some 3.5 m high, and the tail streamers could easily have doubled this. Thus it would have been similar in size to the red damask banner of a standing Bodhisattva (Fig. H; Pls. 34-1, 34-2), or even longer.</p><p>The full width of the fabric is seen, with a selvedge down each side. For printing, the silk was folded down the centre line, and then in the middle, to produce pairs of confronting horses, repeated upside down below the middle line. The boards used to compress the fabric must have about 70 cm high and 27 cm wide. The design, as discussed by Stein (Serindia, vol.Ⅱ, pp. 910-11) is basically Sasanian, but reveals Chinese workmanship by “the spirited life-like rendering of the ponies’ figures and the free trotting movement with which they are represented.... In the lower pair of ponies, with their short thick-set bodies, heavy heads, and short ears, the type peculiar to the Mongol horse, as I know it, is quite unmistakable. The pair above, with their spotted coats and heavy bellies, are meant evidently for a different type, which, however, owing to the missing heads, cannot be determined.”</p><p>Besides these knowledgeable observations on the horses, Stein also comments on the thinness of the silk and consequent “running” of the colours. This feature can be well understood in the context of the printing technique, which involved sandwiching at least four, and possibly more, layers of silk between boards.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，8～9世紀</p><p>敦煌出土</p><p>夾纈印染絹</p><p>高68.6釐米 寬52.5釐米</p><p>MAS885（Ch.00357）</p><p>此斷片可能比圖12中所示的幡大很多。原來此斷片的上方綴縫著大小大致相同的紅色絹。如果假定其是四片的幡，那麽幡頭和幡身就達3.5米左右，幡腳應足以超過其兩倍。因此，整體的尺寸與繪著觀音菩薩像的赤色綾幡（參照Fig 11，圖34-1、圖34-2）大致相同，只是前者稍長。</p><p>此斷片的兩側有織邊，這正好說明是滿幅絹。印紋樣時，先把絹縱向對折，然後從中央馬的下方再次橫向對折。因而，中央部位出現了面對面、形狀相同的小馬，在下方可見到與它們反向的，倒著的小馬腿。此夾纈染用的板，大概高有70釐米，寬有27釐米左右。其風格上正如斯坦因所講述的（參照《西域》910頁），基本上是薩珊朝的，但加了中國式的手法。關於此紋樣，斯坦因說“小馬的姿態被表現的生動活潑，令人有輕快的動感……下方的一對小馬，無疑抓住了我都非常瞭解的蒙古馬的特徵，小而肥的身體、大頭、短耳等。上方的一對，從身體上有斑文，看似很重的腹部看，顯然和下方的一對不同，但缺頭部，無法判別。”</p><p>斯坦因除對馬有豐富觀察之外，還對絹的薄厚、色彩的深淺也有記述。關於那些特徵，如果考慮此斷片一次至少有四塊，或者可能是更多的絹，夾在板子間採用夾纈技法染的，那麽可以說是極其自然的事。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n=" Vol. 3 Plate 16"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.28*</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Detail of the border from a painting dated</title><title lang="chi-Hant">892年綾地夾纈花纹邊絹（局部）</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 9th century A.D.</p><p>A.D. 892 (see Vol. 1, Pl. 26)</p><p>From Dunhuang</p><p>Silk damask printed in jiaxie technique</p><p>W. 4.5 cm</p><p>Stein painting 28* (Ch. xx. 005)</p><p>The majority of silk paintings from Dunhuang have borders of plain silk or of hemp cloth for strength.

As with the headpiece of the banner in Pl. 12,each motif appears to have been separately printed, first in blue and then in yellow. One block was used for the centre floret, and the leaf-like extensions were applied separately; the latter were also on their own, in facing pairs (see the whole border in Vol. 1, Pl. 26). The subsequent application of the yellow produced yellow in the spaces between the petals, and green where it was applied over the blue. Since the border is complete, the date of the silk of which it is composed may be close to that of the painting itself, which is late ninth century A.D.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，9世紀</p><p>（見第1卷圖26）</p><p>敦煌出土</p><p>幅寬4.5釐米</p><p>斯坦因繪畫28*(Ch.xx.005)</p><p>敦煌出土繪畫的大部分，爲了保護其邊緣，鑲了平絹或麻的邊。此邊絹是綴飾第1卷圖26絹繪《大悲救苦觀世音菩薩像》的邊，此印花絹邊的存在，瞭解到不僅是幡頭（參照圖10～12、42等），大型供養畫的周邊也使用華麗圖案的絹。因此可以說，衆多小斷片中有可能摻雜著曾經是絹繪的邊布斷片。看似和圖12幡的幡頭所用的夾纈狀況相同，以最初用青色，再用黃色的思路順序分開染的。紋樣中央的花紋是一塊，但其四邊的葉狀部分卻單獨分佈，它們未與花紋組合在一起，還有兩組相對的地方（參照第1卷圖26）。以上青色紋樣部分連接著染黃的部分，那花瓣間白底子上的黃色與花瓣和葉子的青色重疊的部分，呈現出了綠色。此邊絹保存完好，大致和絹繪的製作年代同時期，即9世紀末的作品。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n=" Vol. 3 Plate 17-1"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.878</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Two fragments with floral pattern</title><title lang="chi-Hant">平絹地夾纈花纹斷片</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 8th century A.D.</p><p>From Dunhuang</p><p>Silk printed in jiaxie technique</p><p>17-1: 9.1×17.0 cm</p><p>17-2: 6.6×17.0 cm</p><p>MAS 878, 879(Ch. 00305)</p><p>The colours in these two fragments have been much better preserved than the colours in some of the other fabrics printed in the same technique, thus giving an excellent idea of what some of them may have looked like originally.

Three colours-blue, yellow and red- were used in the printing, the blue combining with the yellow to produce green and with the red in the hexagons to make a purplish brown.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，8世紀</p><p>敦煌出土</p><p>夾纈印染絹</p><p>17－1：17.0×9.1釐米</p><p>17－2：17.0×6.6釐米</p><p>MAS878、879(ch.00305)</p><p>此兩件斷片顔色的保存狀況，遠比其他夾纈斷片好，這讓人追念當時其他作品也曾經有過這樣美麗的顔色。但是，比這更珍貴的是，小塊的斷片（圖17－2）中，讓人更清楚地看出折疊線與重復紋樣間的關係。因爲絹薄，折疊幾層後夾在板子間，一下子就可印出多個文樣。在夾折疊絹的兩塊板上按紋樣打出孔來，印染時，只將染料浸透各色需要打開的洞。印染此絹時，用了青、黃、紅三種顔色，青和黃色重疊的部分是綠色，而那些加了紅色的六角形部分，呈現出了帶紫色的茶色。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n=" Vol. 3 Plate 18-1"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.876</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Two banner headpieces with bird and flower medallions</title><title lang="chi-Hant">兩個連珠雙鳥唐草紋幡頭</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 8th century A.D.</p><p>From Dunhuang</p><p>Silk printed in jiaxie technique</p><p>18-1: W. 23.8 cm</p><p>18-2: 26.0×26.0 cm</p><p>18-1:MAS 876 (Ch. 00304.a)</p><p>18-2: MAS 877 (Ch. 00304.b)</p><p>See also Fig. 10</p><p>When found by Stein, these two pieces were folded to form triangular headpieces, being “edged with a fine lozenge-diapered sage-green silk, and retaining part of brown side streamers and one set of sage-green silk bottom streamers.” As he pointed out, the design is a Chinese adaptation from a Sasanian type, with large medallions having borders of similar, smaller medallions.

The large lozenge pattern may be compared with that of a complete banner preserved in the Shoso-in and illustrated in Matsumoto, Shoso-in no senshoku (Nihon no Bijutsu, no. 102,Pl.38). However, in the Shoso-in example the floral motifs are in applique, while here, as with the rest of the decoration, they are in the jiaxie technique. The form of the design in large lozenges in both pieces is very similar. The blue of the background is well preserved, but the curling green leaf scrolls filling the diagonals and especially the pink rosettes at their intersections and filling the main panels have faded considerably. In the right-hand lozenge one may see low the pattern is repeated in mirror-reverse due to the folding of the material between boards; the colours are a little stronger in the layer that was uppermost. The material is a very fine damask with small lozenge pattern.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，8～9世紀</p><p>敦煌出土</p><p>夾纈絹</p><p>18.0×32.4釐米</p><p>MAS880(Ch.00307)</p><p>此碎絹片曾是幅寬24釐米的彩絹幡中的一片。幡頭（圖版中未能展現）是褪了色的紅絹，用帶小點紋的茶色綾做邊。此大的菱形聯紋樣，可與『正倉院の染織』（日本美術102）圖版38介紹的灌頂幡的樣式比較。就各段的花紋相比，正倉院例中的紋樣是綴縫的，本圖中的是用夾纈的技法作出的，但兩者的形式卻極相似。地的青色基本保留下來，但菱形中配飾的唐草狀綠色小葉紋和散布在地上的淡紅色小花紋，褪色卻相當嚴重。圖版右端的菱形紋樣中，留有明顯的折疊痕，可窺出那種將絹折疊後夾在板子間，使左右完全對稱的紋樣反復出現的染色技法的痕迹。折疊成若干層的絹中，最上邊一層的顔色較其它部分稍深。底絹是精致的帶菱形格紋的綾。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n=" Vol. 3 Plate 20-1"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.931</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Two fragments with floral patterns</title><title lang="chi-Hant">兩塊花纹斷片</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 8th century A.D.</p><p>From Dunhuang</p><p>Silk printed in jiaxie technique</p><p>20-1:11.0×25.0 cm</p><p>20-2:5.8×16.5 cm</p><p>20-1: MAS 931 (Ch. 00309.a)</p><p>20-2: MAS 932 (Ch. 00510.a)</p><p>The larger fragment (Pl. 20-1), with its carefully rolled edge, must be part of a panel from a textile banner; the smaller piece (Pl. 20-2) is from a hanging loop, opened out.

The design, which is in 3/1 twill on a ground of tightly woven 2/1 twill, is of a large peacock displaying and holding in its beak a knot, part of an interlacing band.

As Stein observed, the concentric lozenge pattern turns into a key-pattern, but there are many variations, not evenly done and so not intended as a deliberate key-pattern. The pattern is in 3/1 twill and the ground is plain. The dull purple streamer to the left is similar but slightly finer and more closely woven.</p><p>The bright red fragment (Pl. 29-2), about 15 by 9 cm, is only part of the main piece of a sutra wrapper, similar to the one shown in Pl.6. The main piece, already fragmentary when Stein described it, was about 45 by 27 cm, and the whole wrapper was about 64 cm long. The fastening band and diagonal supports are illustrated in colour in Serindia (Pl. CVI), and are described by Stein as having the same weave, pattern and colouring as Ch. 00171 (MAS 919; Serindia, Pl. CXI), except that the ground is deep blue.

Figure 11 shows the whole banner, with a seated Buddha in the headpiece. The Bodhisattva stands beneath a garlanded canopy. Only part of the cartouche on the left remains, ending with the characters pusa, or Bodhisattva; this must have originally identified the figure. On the right is another cartouche, read by Waley (Catalogue, p. 188) as follows:</p><p>May the land be peaceful and its people prosperous;</p><p>May the rural shrines continually flourish.</p><p>May the whole house be clear and happy;</p><p>May the lives (of the inhabitants) be long extended.</p><p>At the top of the banner is a valance bordered with rosettes and pairs of half-rosettes, surmounted by the triangular headpiece (Fig. 11). The nimbus has a border of rather well-spaced cloud motifs. The general configuration is reminiscent of Tang ninth-century models (stein compared it to the “Indian” Bodhisattva; see Vol. 1, Pl. 51), but the large scale and indifferent execution of the characters may point to a date late in the ninth century or even in the tenth century. The whole banner, which is painted in silver and not a substitute, must have looked very splendid when new, quite suited to the lavish scale of the tenth-century caves at Dunhuang. The silver, possibly applied as leaf, is quite thickly preserved in parts; elsewhere only the underdrawing or sizing remains. The eyes are accented with fine ink outlines.</p><p>As for the textiles of the banner, the headpiece has a faded border that has lost its colour and design. The design, as still visible to Stein from the back, is described in Serindia, Vol.Ⅱ, p. 1037, and consisted of salmon pink floral spots on a bluish white ground. Part remains also of an indigo border of plain silk, which has helped to preserve the colour of the red damask of the triangular panel with the seated Buddha. This is of one piece with the main part of the banner, and consists of a whole width of silk damask, about 60 cm selvedge to selvedge. A reconstruction of the design is seen in Serindia, Pl. CXXII. The details in this plate show parts of the design where they can best be seen: the group of four birds flying towards a central quatrefoil rosette, and the flowers with clear lotus centres, on stems growing inward from the edges between each group of birds. Ground and pattern are woven in twills, running in the same direction. The repeats in the design occur approximately every 15 cm.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐末·五代時期，9世紀</p><p>敦煌出土</p><p>綾地銀泥</p><p>高386.0釐米 寬68.1釐米</p><p>斯坦因繪畫217（Ch.xxviii.007）</p><p>參照Fig.11</p><p>比真身大的此菩薩像，作爲繪畫資料，收錄於第1卷乃或第2卷，則顯得損壞過於嚴重，因此作爲綾的資料，收錄於本卷中。包括幡頭的坐佛在內的整體幡，展示在Fig.11中。菩薩站立在被花環裝飾的華蓋下。左側的長方形題記框中，僅有末尾菩薩兩字，無疑當時在這裏沒有記入像名。右側也有一題記，Waley將此題記釋讀如下（參照《敦煌畫目錄》，188頁）。</p><p>願國安民泰社稷恒昌</p><p>闔它清吉壽命延長</p><p>“祈願國泰民安，社稷繁榮昌盛，家家清潔幸福，人人長壽□□□”</p><p>幡的上端為三角形(Fig. 11)，有花紋和相對的半花紋交叉排列的邊飾，其下繪著垂幕。頭光上排列著適當間隔的雲紋。其整體印象使人想起9世紀的作品（斯坦因與第1卷圖51的印度式菩薩做了比較），從尺寸的大小以及不見有個性的表現等方面看，可以判斷其年代爲9世紀末至10世紀左右。整個畫像都未使用代用品，全都用銀泥描繪，當時是非常華麗的，正與敦煌10世紀时規模宏大的作品吻合。銀可能使用的像箔那麽厚，現在都已基本脫落，只留下了底描線和礬水的痕迹。眼睛是用細墨線強調的。</p><p>至於此幡的織物，幡頭可看出顔色和紋樣完全消失了的山形絹邊。關於其圖案，斯坦因寫報告書時，似乎曾從內側看過，在《西域》（1037頁）中，有青白色地上分佈著淡紅色的小花的記載。也留下一部分深藍色平絹的邊布，其下邊曾是三角形幡頭部分的綾地上，仍殘留著發紅的顔色。此幡頭部分也是由和幡的主要部分連在一起的絹子作成，此幡使用的是兩端有織邊的幅寬約60釐米的絹。《西域》（參照圖版CXXII）中收錄了織紋設計的復原圖。本書中展示的是織紋顯得最清楚的兩處。紋樣的構成是四瓣花的周圍飛翔著四隻鳥，及從織邊到織邊橫向延伸的莖的上下，飾有帶蓮子的蓮花和葉子的圖案。質地、紋樣也都是同方綾，紋樣每隔約15釐米重復一次。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n=" Vol. 3 Plate 35"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.888</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Banner headpiece with seated Buddhas</title><title lang="chi-Hant">綾地彩畫佛坐像幡頭</title><note lang="eng"><p>Five Dynasties, 10th century A.D.</p><p>From Dunhuang</p><p>Ink and colours on silk damask</p><p>52.5×51.7 cm</p><p>MAS 888 (Ch. xxi. 003)</p><p>This fragment shows how many of the banner headpieces were made by simply folding a square of silk and painting almost identical designs on the two sides. The width of the banner, as gauged from the diagonal, would have been some 70 cm; that is, even larger than largest banners now in the collection (Fig. 11, Pls. 15, 34; Vol. 2, Pls. 32-33). With the original purple silk border, already faded to brown when found by Stein, the total width of the headpiece was 3 feet (90 cm).</p><p>There is a selvedge along the top of the piece. The pattern of the silk is very large and fine; Stein thought that it was floral, but close examination shows that it is of phoenixes, the head and crest of one being just visible next to the upper Buddha, and part of the tail of another phoenix below. The silk itself must have been over 60 cm wide, perhaps as much as 70 to 75 cm. On the back, the pattern is slightly more distinct. An interesting feature of the painting is the strong yellow pigment, visible only from the back, applied beneath the flesh colour of the face and exposed shest of each of the Buddhas. The type of lotus seat, the symmettical disposition of the lotus stems, leaves and flowers, and the simplified depiction of the two Buddha figures all suggest a date in the tenth century.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>五代時期，10世紀</p><p>敦煌出土</p><p>綾織、設色</p><p>52.5×51.7釐米</p><p>MAS888（Ch.xxi.003）</p><p>四方的絹沿對角線對折，在兩側繪大致相同的畫，是用於幡頭的織物，可能曾經製作過許多件。從對角線的尺寸看，幡的幅寬大約爲70釐米，比斯坦因收集品中現存的最大級的作品（Fig. 11，圖15、34，以及第2卷圖32、33等的幡）還要大。大概當時是紫色，斯坦因發現時，仍帶著已經變成茶色的絹邊，包括這部分在內，幡頭的幅寬可達3英尺（90釐米）。</p><p>斷片的上端還留著織邊。紋樣極大、極美。斯坦因認爲是花紋樣，而從現在所能看到的部分，可確定它是鳳凰。緊靠上方佛的右旁是頭和冠毛，下方佛的左側可見部分尾巴。此絹本身幅寬也超過了60釐米，恐怕可達到70～75釐米左右。從背面看，雖然是一點點，卻看得很清楚，還能發現畫像有趣的事情。之所以這樣說，是因爲小佛的頭和胸部等的膚色使用了黃色顔料，只從表面看，卻不能發現其強烈的黃色。從蓮華座的莖、葉、花是左右對稱的形式，以及小佛的簡略化的描繪等看，大概是10世紀的。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n=" Vol. 3 Plate 36"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.1128</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Fragment of a painted border</title><title lang="chi-Hant">彩畫斷片</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 8th – 9th century A.D.</p><p>From Dunhuang</p><p>Ink and colours on silk</p><p>H. 6.5 cm, L. 40.0cm</p><p>MAS 1128</p><p>This fragment, perhaps originally part of an ornamental border, was not actually catalogued by Stein, but there is no doubt that its provenance is Dunhuang. Probably the interest of this piece only emerged when it was unfolded; it may have been used as a streamer, and has clearly been cut from a longer and wider piece for such a purpose. The design is of birds flying up towards a stupa or a flaming jewel. One bird is preserved almost complete, and suggests a hoopoe, though without a crest. Of the others only small parts are visible, enough to show that two birds on each side were flying up to the central motif. They were drawn in ink with very light and fluent touches of the brush and then coloured. The drawing of the floral scrolls in the corner of the piece is equally rapid and light-hearted, so that the whole fragment has a character unique among the textiles from Dunhuang.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，8～9世紀</p><p>敦煌出土</p><p>絹，設色</p><p>高6.5釐米 寬40.0釐米</p><p>MAS1128</p><p>此斷片可能是絹飾的一部分，斯坦因的記錄中沒有記載，但它確實是敦煌出土的。其紋樣的産生，有意思的是沒有使用折疊的形式，其形狀也許是用於幡尾，裁斷更長更寬的絹而成的。圖案爲鳥向寶珠或塔類物飛翔的樣子。一隻鳥大致完整的保留下來，好像是沒有冠毛的戴勝。其他，雖然都非常小，卻能認出兩隻鳥的尾巴和嘴，是從兩側飛過來的。這些是用流利的淡墨線描出的，加了淡彩色。左端是花，唐草紋樣，同樣也是用麻利輕快的線描表現出來的。因而，此斷片在敦煌攜來的染織中，也呈現出了極獨特的情況。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n=" Vol. 3 Plate 37"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.926</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Two fragments, probably from the headpiece of a banner</title><title lang="chi-Hant">兩張幡頭斷片</title><note lang="eng"><p>Eastern Han dynasty (A.D. 25-220)</p><p>From Dunhuang</p><p>Silk double cloth</p><p>14.2×20.3 (larger piece)</p><p>MAS 926 (Ch. 00118)</p><p>See also Fig. 12</p><p>These two fragments and those shown in Pl. 38 are earlier and quite different from the other textiles found at Dunhuang. Similar examples are known, however, such as the one illustrated in Pl. 80 of Xinjiang chutu wenwu, which was excavated in 1968 from the Chinese cemetery at Astana and which has the same spiral wave scroll that is seen here, besides having the same general effect. Another example, excavated at Astana in 1972 and dated to the Northern Liang dynasty, has pairs of large and small beasts, arranged facing each other or feet to feet, beneath a wide-banded arcade (ibid., Pl. 56). The first of these pieces excavated at Astana is especially important since it shows a clear selvedge, as well as colour changes and pattern changes, which show it to be a warp-faced fabric. It has two colours, blue and white (purple and white in the Stein fragments), in the warp, and white only in the weft. As can be seen in the present plate, the white weft tends to show at times in the purple areas. The fabric can be distinguished as a double cloth by the fact that the threads run the same way front and back, unlike a twill. Judging from the degree of wear on this side, the pattern was probably intended to appear in white on the purple background, as shown in the colour plate. The pattern shows up more clearly on the back (see Fig. 12). A small fragment of a much larger variation of the same arcading with double cloud spiral border is found in MAS 803 (not illustrated here).</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>後漢時期，25～220年</p><p>敦煌出土</p><p>雙層錦</p><p>下片14.2×20.3釐米</p><p>MAS926（Ch.00118）</p><p>參照Fig.12</p><p>本圖的兩個斷片和下圖的兩個斷片，與敦煌發現的其他染織品本質不同，年代也早。然而，並不是見不到其他同類作品不能解釋，例如《新疆出土文物》刊載的第80圖，1968年從新疆維吾爾自治區阿斯塔那古墓出土的《騎士對獸毬文錦》上見到的相同螺旋形波狀紋，整體感覺也非常類似。另外，1972年在阿斯塔那發現的有北涼紀年的《禽獸紋錦》（參照《新疆出土紋物》北京1975年，圖版56）上，拱形下有大小幾組的動物，有的面對面，有的腳與腳連接。無論阿斯塔那發掘的這些斷片，還是前者，雖然紋樣已變色歪扭，但織邊仍保留了下來，能判斷出是經錦這一點，是非常重要的。經線爲青、白兩色（本圖的斷片中是紫和白色），緯線只是白色。正如圖版上也能看清的，白色緯線在織物的表面上僅顯現一點。此錦的織法，線在正反面的出現是相同的，所以明白是兩層經線。從其磨損情況看，彩色圖版中所展示的面是正面，可能是紫色地上呈現出白色紋樣，而反面的紋樣卻較爲鮮明（Fig. 12）。斯坦因收集品中還有一片（MAS803：本書中未收取），有兩段與此斷片相同的螺旋形的雲狀紋，有變形的拱形織紋，那紋樣只留下了一小部分。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n=" Vol. 3 Plate 38"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.820</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Fragments</title><title lang="chi-Hant">斷片</title><note lang="eng"><p>Eastern Han dynasty (A.D. 25-220)</p><p>From a watchtower on the Dunhuang border wall</p><p>Warp-patterned silk double cloth</p><p>Lower piece: 6.8×19.0 cm</p><p>MAS 820 (T. XXⅡ. c. 0010.a)</p><p>Both from the place of discovery and from the style of their design, these must be among the earliest of the textiles found by Stein. Before investigating the Mogao caves, or Qianfodong, Stein spent some weeks investigating the limes, or whole line of watchtowers, along the westernmost extension of the Great Wall. Each watchtower was identified by the letter T (for Tun-huang) and a Roman numeral. The two fragments here, chosen from a group of nine, all but one of which show the same pattern, are from watchtower number T. XXII. c, the tower at which Stein recovered a document that was the earliest of all those from the limes, dated to a year corresponding to 98 B.C. Stein investigated this tower on May 13, 1907, the last day before turning back to Dunhuang itself.</p><p>The material is a double cloth in plain weave, hence very tight and close. It is extremely worn on one side, and so the illustration shows what may have been the reverse, with the pattern in indigo on a faded gold, rather than the other way around. Stein described it best:</p><p>Among the very numerous fragments of fabrics [found at this watchtower] ... the most interesting piece ... is the patchwork ... made up of small strips of a figured silk in indigo and yellow-green. It contains figures of dragons, birds and phoenixes set in highly conventional scroll-work, and other ornamental designs. The general style and treatment are unmistakably Chinese, as may reasonably be expected in a decorated silk dating from Han times, when China still claimed the monopoly of producing textiles of that material. The extremely fine weaving attests the high technical level reached in this essentially Chinese manufacture. The piece claims importance as one of the oldest specimens of textile art undoubtedly Chinese, and the indications it furnishes as to style and technique have since received striking confirmation from the abundant finds of brocades, dating from Han times, which I discovered in 1914 at cemeteries of the Lou-lan area.</p><p>In view of the early date of the specimen and the certainty of its origin, it is all the more interesting to find in it certain elements of design, like the four birds grouped round what suggests a conventional tree, fore-shadowing motifs which we are apt to consider as characteristic of textile art in the Persia of Sassanian times and in the Near-Eastern regions influenced by it. (Serindia, Vol. I, p. 720)</p><p>Stein drew attention, in a footnote, to the “curious figured fabric” from Dunhuang, shown here in Pl. 37. The two fabrics are indeed very close in weaving technique, in general organization of the design with pairs of animals, and in details such as the hooked volutes at the centres and the hatched edges to the lozenges. Similar features such as rather large hooked volutes are found on another silk textile from Dunhuang, MAS 803. They are also found in other specimens from Xinjiang, which are referred to in the notes to Pl. 37.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>後漢時期，25～220年</p><p>敦煌漢長城烽火臺遺址出土</p><p>雙層龍鳳紋經錦</p><p>下片6.8×19.0釐米</p><p>MAS820（T.XXII.C.0010.a）</p><p>從發現的地點以及紋樣的樣式看，此斷片在斯坦因收集的染織品中是時代最早的。斯坦因將考察敦煌前的幾周，花費在長城西端斷斷續續延伸的漢代烽火臺遺址的考察上。他在T字母（敦煌的首字母）上加羅馬數字來標示那些烽火臺遺址，本圖中的斷片，是從標注爲T. XXII.C的烽火臺獲得的九件斷片中的兩件。那九件，除了一件外，其餘都有相同的紋樣。並且，斯坦因在一連串烽火臺遺址上發現的全部遺物中，在此烽火臺發現了最早的，記有公元前98年紀年的。斯坦因考察此地是在1907年5月13日，是返回敦煌莫高窟的前夕。</p><p>此斷片是平地的經錦，織紋細密。圖版中展示的，褪色的金色底子上顯現深藍色紋樣的面，大概是反面，但相反的面破損嚴重。有關此斷片，斯坦因個人有很精闢的解說，引用如下。“（從此烽火臺發現的）衆多的紡織品碎片中，最有意義的是，……斷片拼接物，……由織出的深藍色和黃綠色紋樣的細長條錦構成。這些斷片，在傳統的渦卷和其它裝飾中，還組合有龍、鳥、鳳凰等紋樣。總體上看，其風格和技法勿庸置疑都是中國的，絲織物在漢代時期是中國獨有的製品。織法也極美，技術水準顯示出只有中國製品才能達到的高度。在以後的1914年，我從樓蘭古墓發現了大量漢代織錦片，對於此風格和技法，可以說是取得了極有衝突力的確鑿證據，此件織錦爲中國最早的織物之一，而得到了重視。针对年代古老和出土地點確鑿來說，此時我們往往認爲的具有薩珊王朝時期的波斯及其影響下的近東地區染織品的特點，如圖案化的樹類物周圍環繞四隻鳥的紋樣等，就非常有意义了。”（參照《西域》720頁）。</p><p>斯坦因在上述解說的腳註中，把本書圖37的斷片作爲敦煌出土的“值得注意的織物”列出。這兩件織物的紡織技法、相對動物組合圖案的構成方法，中心是鈎狀的渦卷形及邊上是絨毛狀的菱紋等紋樣的細部，都有類似之處。與此相似的較大的鈎狀渦卷圖案，在敦煌出土的其他斷片（MAS803）中也見到過。另外，在上圖的解說中列舉的新疆維吾爾自治區出土的斷片中，也見到同類的紋樣。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n=" Vol. 3 Plate 39-1"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.924</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Fragments of figured silk</title><title lang="chi-Hant">錦斷片</title><note lang="eng"><p>39-1: Sui dynasty (A.D. 581-617),The others: Tang dynasty (A.D.618-906)</p><p>From Dunhuang</p><p>Double cloth</p><p>39-1: W. 6.2 cm</p><p>39-2: W.2.8 cm</p><p>39-3: W.3.8cm</p><p>39-1: MAS 924 (Ch. 00173)</p><p>39-2: MAS 864 (Ch.00182)</p><p>39-3: MAS 923 (Ch. 00297)</p><p>See also Fig. 13</p><p>(39-1) As Stein concluded from the remains of paper backing found adhering to this fragment, it was probably once used as the border of a sutra roll cover, such as the ones shown in Pls. 6 and 7.However, it is not satin twill as he described it, but a double cloth in plain weave on both sides.

The design is typical of those of Sasanian origin, with confronting deer inside large pearl medallions, and confronting geese in the spaces left between the rows of medallions.

The very fine weft (Stein describes this as the warp, but it is almost certainly the weft) can be seen along one edge; the warp is broader. The front is in 2/1 twill and the back in plain weave. With such a small fragment it is not possible to reconstruct the original intricate and stylized pattern.</p><p>(41-3) According to Stein’s description, these three fragments formed a strip from the back of a Buddhist devotional handbook printed in A.D. 949. The fabric itself must have been quite old when it was so used. The design is based on Sasanian pearled medallions within which are branched square palmettes apparently arranged in threes. The left-hand fragment shows a selvedge, tightly woven, with cut ends of which a few turn. The direction of the warp in the other two fragments is t right angles to this one.</p><p>(41-4) This very fine piece would seem to be earlier than most of the textiles found at Dunhuang, with the exception of the double cloths seen in Pls. 37 and 38. Stein found three fragments of which the British Museum’s piece (shown here) is the largest. It is a twill on the front and plain weave on the back.</p><p>It is primarily the resemblance of the design to some larger, now fairly well-known fragments from Xinjiang province that suggests an early date. One such was excavated at Astana near Turfan in 1959 from tomb no. 303, with a date in the Eastern Jin corresponding to A.D. 551. It has a decoration based on a tree motif in red on bands of white, green and blue. A small chequerboard pattern in white appears in the centre of each tree, very much in the fashion of the arc of four small white rectangles found on each petal in the Stein piece. Larger pieces complete with selvedge have also been found at Turfan (cf. the set of postcards issued by the Wenwu Press). The petals are described as “hearts” by Stein, but they can hardly have been so interpreted by those who made and used this silk. The base of each petal is in a different colour: bright blue and rose pink here, and, according to Stein’s description, myrtle green in one of the other fragments.</p><p>(41-5, upper fragment) The weft here is of fine pink stiffened silk, the warp broader (Stein describes the fine stiffened silk as the warp). Enough remains of the design to show that it consisted of rows of large circles, about 15 cm in diameter, with four- armed lozenge-shaped floral spots between them. The centre of each spot is in red and light green, edged in yellow. From it spring trefoil petals in red and white, and beyond these there are four trefoil leaves again in red and light green and edged in yellow.</p><p>(41-5, lower fragment) This fragment formed the suspension loop for a banner headpiece illustrated in Serindia, Pl. LXII. The weave is 2/1 twill on the front and plain weave on the back. The weft is a soft golden yellow.</p><p>The design, on an indigo ground, is of rows of six-petalled rosettes; rows are alternately pale pink or bright orange-red. A pair of ducks faces each of the paler rosettes, holding a garland from which a flower springs and a leaf drops. Another garland hangs between them from their breasts, and from it depends the lozenge-shaped base on which they stand, with double loop and streamers below that. The ducks themselves are, as Stein observed, “admirably life-like”: their heads, breast-patches and tails are in orange-red, with the rest in yellow and white, and markings of the same indigo (described as “myrtle-green” by Stein) as the ground. By this variety and subtlety of markings, they are related to the other designs with pairs of ducks in the collection, such as the tiny but very bright ducks in the patchwork altar cloth and those of another fabric in the same patchwork (Pl. 9-7).</p><p>(41-6) The design in this fragment, which has a 3/1 twill on the front and plain weave on the back, is similar to that found on the printed fabric along the rear of a previous patchwork (see Pl. 9, No. 15). In the present piece, one row of spots is preserved almost completely: around the edge of each are eight trilobate petal shapes, alternately green and blue. The spots in alternate rows are incomplete but must have been lozenge-shaped with four instead of eight arms ending in similar trilobate petal shapes supported on volutes. More elaborate forms, as noted by Stein, appear in Chinese silver and in Chinese textiles in the Shoso-in, while ceiling patterns in the Tang caves at Dunhuang offer almost endless variations based on similar elements. Some of the closest comparisons can be made with Tang silks found at Astana (e.g., Sichou zhilu Pls. 43-44, from a tomb dated A.D. 778).</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>41－4 北朝時期（5～6世紀），其餘爲唐代（7～8世紀）</p><p>敦煌出土</p><p>經錦</p><p>41－1：4.2×4.0釐米……MAS872（Ch.00229）</p><p>41－2：41－1的背面</p><p>41－3：從左，4.3×6.7釐米，7.1×4.0釐米，2.9×4.0釐米</p><p>……MAS917（Ch.0026）</p><p>41－4：4.6×12.5釐米……MAS922（Ch.00178）</p><p>41－5：（上）長23.0釐米，（下）6.0×21.3釐米</p><p>……MAS918（Ch.0061.a）, MAS921（Ch.00165.b）</p><p>41－6：幅寬3.8釐米……MAS923（Ch.00297）</p><p>圖41－1和圖41－2分別是三角形小斷片的正反面。沿著垂直邊可看到極細的緯線（斯坦因把它當作了經線，確切的應該是緯線），經線使用比它粗的線。正面是三枚綾，反面是平織。因是斷片很小，不可能復原出它的整體纹樣。</p><p>圖41－3中展示的三件斷片，據斯坦因所記，是貼在有乾祐二年（949年）紀年的木版佛經冊裏的。但此錦本身不用說是早期織物，可能是古布的再利用。</p><p>圖案是以薩珊波斯風格的聯珠圓紋爲基礎，其中配有三個帶枝的方形花紋。左邊斷片的端脫落成鋸齒狀，但還能見到織邊，可以確認是經錦。</p><p>圖41－4是非常美的斷片，在敦煌發現的織物中，也僅次於圖37、圖38中所展示的經錦，可以說是非常早期的作品。斯坦因發現的三件斷片中，這裏展示的斷片是最大的，現收藏于大英博物館。面是綾織，反面是平織。</p><p>紋樣的基本結構，與人們所知的中國新疆地區出土的若干件早期的較大作品相似。其中之一，是1959年從吐魯番阿斯塔那303號墓（有推斷爲551年的墓誌）發掘出來的斷片，白、綠、青色帶紋上用紅色織出了樹紋。各種樹的中央用白色加了小的棋盤格紋，這與本圖斷片的各個花瓣上，以弓形排列的白色小方形的狀況相似。從吐魯番還發現了幾件有織邊的較大斷片（參照《文物精華》二）。斯坦因的記錄中，把花瓣紋稱作“心形”，那是織此錦並使用的人們的不同理解。花瓣基部使用了不同顔色，這裏的是隔行配着亮青色和紅色，據斯坦因的記述，別的斷片中還有綠色。</p><p>圖41－5上方的斷片，緯線是細而結實的淡紅色，而經線則是粗線（斯坦因的記述中細而結實的線是經線）。其圖案構成，從殘存的紋樣完全能推斷出，是由直徑約15釐米的大圓排成列，其間連接圓的四方形中配三葉紋的菱形紋樣。點紋的中心加了紅和淡綠，周圍用黃色做邊。其外側是用紅色和白色表現的三葉形花瓣，再外側是配了四個用黃色做邊的紅和淡綠的三葉紋。</p><p>圖41－5下方的斷片，是曾用作《西域》圖版LXII中展示的幡頭吊環。正面是三枚綾，反面則是平織，緯線的顔色像金色的柔和黃色。</p><p>圖案是交錯相配的藍色地上淡紅色和亮橙色的六瓣花的行列，其間加了帶花和莖的花飾，和面向淡紅色花的一對鳥。從鳥的胸部伸出另一花飾，鳥棲在從那花飾上吊下的菱形裝飾上，再其下是垂著蝴蝶結的飄帶裝飾。正如斯坦因記述的，鳥是“非常寫實”的，頭、胸部是斑點，尾巴是橙紅色，身體其他部分是用黃和白色來表現，眼睛和翅膀的線和底色一樣都用藍色（斯坦因記錄爲帶青色的深綠色）。此鳥極富變化的精妙表現，使人覺得與斯坦因收集的，如小片布拼成的《袈裟》（圖9）上所見的極小卻非常鮮亮的一對家鴨等織物圖樣中所見的鳥的若干圖案有密切關連。</p><p>41－6圖的斷片，正面爲四枚綾，反面是平織，其圖案設計與圖9《袈裟》後邊的夾纈染的圖案相似（參照同圖解說15）。紋樣恰好保留了一行大致完整的部分，大的花紋周圍，各自交叉排列著八個青和綠色的三瓣花。其上下行列的圖案幾乎未能保留下來，但從上行的殘部看，渦卷形的四方中配有相同的三瓣花的菱形紋樣。如斯坦因所述，使此圖案更具華麗形式的物品，見於正倉院傳下來的中國制銀器和染織品上。另外，敦煌唐代的天井畫紋樣上也有基本形式相同的各種圖案。再有，斯坦因發現的唐代絹中，也有許多件有極密切聯繫的作品（例如《絲綢之路》圖版43、44的，與大曆十三年（778年）的文書一同從381號墓出土的《變體寶相華紋錦》等）。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n=" Vol. 3 Plate 41-2"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.917</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Silk fragments</title><title lang="chi-Hant">經錦斷片</title><note lang="eng"><p>41-4: Northern Dynasties, 5th – 6th century A.D.</p><p>From Dunhuang</p><p>The others: Tang dynasty, 7th- 8th century A.D. or earlier</p><p>Warp-faced compound weave</p><p>41-1: 4.0×4.2 cm</p><p>41-2:reverse side of 41-1</p><p>41-3:(from left) 4.3×6.7 cm, 7.1×4.0 cm, 2.9×4.0 cm</p><p>41-4: 4.6×12.5 cm</p><p>41-5: (above) L. 23.0 cm; (below) 6.0×21.3 cm</p><p>41-6: W. 3.8 cm</p><p>41-1:MAS 872 (Ch. 00229)</p><p>41-2:MAS 917 (Ch. 0026)</p><p>41-3:MAS 922 (Ch. 00178)</p><p>41-4:MAS 918 (Ch. 0061.a)</p><p>41-5:MAS 921 (Ch. 00165.b)</p><p>41-6:MAS 919 (Ch. 00171)</p><p>(41-1, 41-2) This small triangular fragment is shown here from both sides. The very fine weft (Stein describes this as the warp, but it is almost certainly the weft) can be seen along one edge; the warp is broader. The front is in 2/1 twill and the back in plain weave. With such a small fragment it is not possible to reconstruct the original intricate and stylized pattern.</p><p>(41-3) According to Stein’s description, these three fragments formed a strip from the back of a Buddhist devotional handbook printed in A.D. 949. The fabric itself must have been quite old when it was so used. The design is based on Sasanian pearled medallions within which are branched square palmettes apparently arranged in threes. The left-hand fragment shows a selvedge, tightly woven, with cut ends of which a few turn. The direction of the warp in the other two fragments is t right angles to this one.</p><p>(41-4) This very fine piece would seem to be earlier than most of the textiles found at Dunhuang, with the exception of the double cloths seen in Pls. 37 and 38. Stein found three fragments of which the British Museum’s piece (shown here) is the largest. It is a twill on the front and plain weave on the back.</p><p>It is primarily the resemblance of the design to some larger, now fairly well-known fragments from Xinjiang province that suggests an early date. One such was excavated at Astana near Turfan in 1959 from tomb no. 303, with a date in the Eastern Jin corresponding to A.D. 551. It has a decoration based on a tree motif in red on bands of white, green and blue. A small chequerboard pattern in white appears in the centre of each tree, very much in the fashion of the arc of four small white rectangles found on each petal in the Stein piece. Larger pieces complete with selvedge have also been found at Turfan (cf. the set of postcards issued by the Wenwu Press). The petals are described as “hearts” by Stein, but they can hardly have been so interpreted by those who made and used this silk. The base of each petal is in a different colour: bright blue and rose pink here, and, according to Stein’s description, myrtle green in one of the other fragments.</p><p>(41-5, upper fragment) The weft here is of fine pink stiffened silk, the warp broader (Stein describes the fine stiffened silk as the warp). Enough remains of the design to show that it consisted of rows of large circles, about 15 cm in diameter, with four- armed lozenge-shaped floral spots between them. The centre of each spot is in red and light green, edged in yellow. From it spring trefoil petals in red and white, and beyond these there are four trefoil leaves again in red and light green and edged in yellow.</p><p>(41-5, lower fragment) This fragment formed the suspension loop for a banner headpiece illustrated in Serindia, Pl.

The very fine weft (Stein describes this as the warp, but it is almost certainly the weft) can be seen along one edge; the warp is broader. The front is in 2/1 twill and the back in plain weave. With such a small fragment it is not possible to reconstruct the original intricate and stylized pattern.</p><p>(41-3) According to Stein’s description, these three fragments formed a strip from the back of a Buddhist devotional handbook printed in A.D. 949. The fabric itself must have been quite old when it was so used. The design is based on Sasanian pearled medallions within which are branched square palmettes apparently arranged in threes. The left-hand fragment shows a selvedge, tightly woven, with cut ends of which a few turn. The direction of the warp in the other two fragments is t right angles to this one.</p><p>(41-4) This very fine piece would seem to be earlier than most of the textiles found at Dunhuang, with the exception of the double cloths seen in Pls. 37 and 38. Stein found three fragments of which the British Museum’s piece (shown here) is the largest. It is a twill on the front and plain weave on the back.</p><p>It is primarily the resemblance of the design to some larger, now fairly well-known fragments from Xinjiang province that suggests an early date. One such was excavated at Astana near Turfan in 1959 from tomb no. 303, with a date in the Eastern Jin corresponding to A.D. 551. It has a decoration based on a tree motif in red on bands of white, green and blue. A small chequerboard pattern in white appears in the centre of each tree, very much in the fashion of the arc of four small white rectangles found on each petal in the Stein piece. Larger pieces complete with selvedge have also been found at Turfan (cf. the set of postcards issued by the Wenwu Press). The petals are described as “hearts” by Stein, but they can hardly have been so interpreted by those who made and used this silk. The base of each petal is in a different colour: bright blue and rose pink here, and, according to Stein’s description, myrtle green in one of the other fragments.</p><p>(41-5, upper fragment) The weft here is of fine pink stiffened silk, the warp broader (Stein describes the fine stiffened silk as the warp). Enough remains of the design to show that it consisted of rows of large circles, about 15 cm in diameter, with four- armed lozenge-shaped floral spots between them. The centre of each spot is in red and light green, edged in yellow. From it spring trefoil petals in red and white, and beyond these there are four trefoil leaves again in red and light green and edged in yellow.</p><p>(41-5, lower fragment) This fragment formed the suspension loop for a banner headpiece illustrated in Serindia, Pl. LXII. The weave is 2/1 twill on the front and plain weave on the back. The weft is a soft golden yellow.</p><p>The design, on an indigo ground, is of rows of six-petalled rosettes; rows are alternately pale pink or bright orange-red. A pair of ducks faces each of the paler rosettes, holding a garland from which a flower springs and a leaf drops. Another garland hangs between them from their breasts, and from it depends the lozenge-shaped base on which they stand, with double loop and streamers below that. The ducks themselves are, as Stein observed, “admirably life-like”: their heads, breast-patches and tails are in orange-red, with the rest in yellow and white, and markings of the same indigo (described as “myrtle-green” by Stein) as the ground. By this variety and subtlety of markings, they are related to the other designs with pairs of ducks in the collection, such as the tiny but very bright ducks in the patchwork altar cloth and those of another fabric in the same patchwork (Pl. 9-7).</p><p>(41-6) The design in this fragment, which has a 3/1 twill on the front and plain weave on the back, is similar to that found on the printed fabric along the rear of a previous patchwork (see Pl. 9, No. 15). In the present piece, one row of spots is preserved almost completely: around the edge of each are eight trilobate petal shapes, alternately green and blue. The spots in alternate rows are incomplete but must have been lozenge-shaped with four instead of eight arms ending in similar trilobate petal shapes supported on volutes. More elaborate forms, as noted by Stein, appear in Chinese silver and in Chinese textiles in the Shoso-in, while ceiling patterns in the Tang caves at Dunhuang offer almost endless variations based on similar elements.

Some of the closest comparisons can be made with Tang silks found at Astana (e.g., Sichou zhilu Pls. 43-44, from a tomb dated A.D. 778).</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>41－4 北朝時期（5～6世紀），其餘爲唐代（7～8世紀）</p><p>敦煌出土</p><p>經錦</p><p>41－1：4.2×4.0釐米……MAS872（Ch.00229）</p><p>41－2：41－1的背面</p><p>41－3：從左，4.3×6.7釐米，7.1×4.0釐米，2.9×4.0釐米</p><p>……MAS917（Ch.0026）</p><p>41－4：4.6×12.5釐米……MAS922（Ch.00178）</p><p>41－5：（上）長23.0釐米，（下）6.0×21.3釐米</p><p>……MAS918（Ch.0061.a）, MAS921（Ch.00165.b）</p><p>41－6：幅寬3.8釐米……MAS923（Ch.00297）</p><p>圖41－1和圖41－2分別是三角形小斷片的正反面。沿著垂直邊可看到極細的緯線（斯坦因把它當作了經線，確切的應該是緯線），經線使用比它粗的線。正面是三枚綾，反面是平織。因是斷片很小，不可能復原出它的整體纹樣。</p><p>圖41－3中展示的三件斷片，據斯坦因所記，是貼在有乾祐二年（949年）紀年的木版佛經冊裏的。但此錦本身不用說是早期織物，可能是古布的再利用。</p><p>圖案是以薩珊波斯風格的聯珠圓紋爲基礎，其中配有三個帶枝的方形花紋。左邊斷片的端脫落成鋸齒狀，但還能見到織邊，可以確認是經錦。</p><p>圖41－4是非常美的斷片，在敦煌發現的織物中，也僅次於圖37、圖38中所展示的經錦，可以說是非常早期的作品。斯坦因發現的三件斷片中，這裏展示的斷片是最大的，現收藏于大英博物館。面是綾織，反面是平織。</p><p>紋樣的基本結構，與人們所知的中國新疆地區出土的若干件早期的較大作品相似。其中之一，是1959年從吐魯番阿斯塔那303號墓（有推斷爲551年的墓誌）發掘出來的斷片，白、綠、青色帶紋上用紅色織出了樹紋。各種樹的中央用白色加了小的棋盤格紋，這與本圖斷片的各個花瓣上，以弓形排列的白色小方形的狀況相似。從吐魯番還發現了幾件有織邊的較大斷片（參照《文物精華》二）。斯坦因的記錄中，把花瓣紋稱作“心形”，那是織此錦並使用的人們的不同理解。花瓣基部使用了不同顔色，這裏的是隔行配着亮青色和紅色，據斯坦因的記述，別的斷片中還有綠色。</p><p>圖41－5上方的斷片，緯線是細而結實的淡紅色，而經線則是粗線（斯坦因的記述中細而結實的線是經線）。其圖案構成，從殘存的紋樣完全能推斷出，是由直徑約15釐米的大圓排成列，其間連接圓的四方形中配三葉紋的菱形紋樣。點紋的中心加了紅和淡綠，周圍用黃色做邊。其外側是用紅色和白色表現的三葉形花瓣，再外側是配了四個用黃色做邊的紅和淡綠的三葉紋。</p><p>圖41－5下方的斷片，是曾用作《西域》圖版LXII中展示的幡頭吊環。正面是三枚綾，反面則是平織，緯線的顔色像金色的柔和黃色。</p><p>圖案是交錯相配的藍色地上淡紅色和亮橙色的六瓣花的行列，其間加了帶花和莖的花飾，和面向淡紅色花的一對鳥。從鳥的胸部伸出另一花飾，鳥棲在從那花飾上吊下的菱形裝飾上，再其下是垂著蝴蝶結的飄帶裝飾。正如斯坦因記述的，鳥是“非常寫實”的，頭、胸部是斑點，尾巴是橙紅色，身體其他部分是用黃和白色來表現，眼睛和翅膀的線和底色一樣都用藍色（斯坦因記錄爲帶青色的深綠色）。此鳥極富變化的精妙表現，使人覺得與斯坦因收集的，如小片布拼成的《袈裟》（圖9）上所見的極小卻非常鮮亮的一對家鴨等織物圖樣中所見的鳥的若干圖案有密切關連。</p><p>41－6圖的斷片，正面爲四枚綾，反面是平織，其圖案設計與圖9《袈裟》後邊的夾纈染的圖案相似（參照同圖解說15）。紋樣恰好保留了一行大致完整的部分，大的花紋周圍，各自交叉排列著八個青和綠色的三瓣花。其上下行列的圖案幾乎未能保留下來，但從上行的殘部看，渦卷形的四方中配有相同的三瓣花的菱形紋樣。如斯坦因所述，使此圖案更具華麗形式的物品，見於正倉院傳下來的中國制銀器和染織品上。另外，敦煌唐代的天井畫紋樣上也有基本形式相同的各種圖案。再有，斯坦因發現的唐代絹中，也有許多件有極密切聯繫的作品（例如《絲綢之路》圖版43、44的，與大曆十三年（778年）的文書一同從381號墓出土的《變體寶相華紋錦》等）。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n=" Vol. 3 Plate 41-6"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.919</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Silk fragments</title><title lang="chi-Hant">經錦斷片</title><note lang="eng"><p>41-4: Northern Dynasties, 5th – 6th century A.D.</p><p>From Dunhuang</p><p>The others: Tang dynasty, 7th- 8th century A.D. or earlier</p><p>Warp-faced compound weave</p><p>41-1: 4.0×4.2 cm</p><p>41-2:reverse side of 41-1</p><p>41-3:(from left) 4.3×6.7 cm, 7.1×4.0 cm, 2.9×4.0 cm</p><p>41-4: 4.6×12.5 cm</p><p>41-5: (above) L. 23.0 cm; (below) 6.0×21.3 cm</p><p>41-6: W. 3.8 cm</p><p>41-1:MAS 872 (Ch. 00229)</p><p>41-2:MAS 917 (Ch. 0026)</p><p>41-3:MAS 922 (Ch. 00178)</p><p>41-4:MAS 918 (Ch. 0061.a)</p><p>41-5:MAS 921 (Ch. 00165.b)</p><p>41-6:MAS 919 (Ch. 00171)</p><p>(41-1, 41-2) This small triangular fragment is shown here from both sides. The very fine weft (Stein describes this as the warp, but it is almost certainly the weft) can be seen along one edge; the warp is broader. The front is in 2/1 twill and the back in plain weave. With such a small fragment it is not possible to reconstruct the original intricate and stylized pattern.</p><p>(41-3) According to Stein’s description, these three fragments formed a strip from the back of a Buddhist devotional handbook printed in A.D. 949. The fabric itself must have been quite old when it was so used. The design is based on Sasanian pearled medallions within which are branched square palmettes apparently arranged in threes. The left-hand fragment shows a selvedge, tightly woven, with cut ends of which a few turn. The direction of the warp in the other two fragments is t right angles to this one.</p><p>(41-4) This very fine piece would seem to be earlier than most of the textiles found at Dunhuang, with the exception of the double cloths seen in Pls. 37 and 38. Stein found three fragments of which the British Museum’s piece (shown here) is the largest. It is a twill on the front and plain weave on the back.</p><p>It is primarily the resemblance of the design to some larger, now fairly well-known fragments from Xinjiang province that suggests an early date. One such was excavated at Astana near Turfan in 1959 from tomb no. 303, with a date in the Eastern Jin corresponding to A.D. 551. It has a decoration based on a tree motif in red on bands of white, green and blue. A small chequerboard pattern in white appears in the centre of each tree, very much in the fashion of the arc of four small white rectangles found on each petal in the Stein piece. Larger pieces complete with selvedge have also been found at Turfan (cf. the set of postcards issued by the Wenwu Press). The petals are described as “hearts” by Stein, but they can hardly have been so interpreted by those who made and used this silk. The base of each petal is in a different colour: bright blue and rose pink here, and, according to Stein’s description, myrtle green in one of the other fragments.</p><p>(41-5, upper fragment) The weft here is of fine pink stiffened silk, the warp broader (Stein describes the fine stiffened silk as the warp). Enough remains of the design to show that it consisted of rows of large circles, about 15 cm in diameter, with four- armed lozenge-shaped floral spots between them. The centre of each spot is in red and light green, edged in yellow. From it spring trefoil petals in red and white, and beyond these there are four trefoil leaves again in red and light green and edged in yellow.</p><p>(41-5, lower fragment) This fragment formed the suspension loop for a banner headpiece illustrated in Serindia, Pl. LXII. The weave is 2/1 twill on the front and plain weave on the back. The weft is a soft golden yellow.</p><p>The design, on an indigo ground, is of rows of six-petalled rosettes; rows are alternately pale pink or bright orange-red. A pair of ducks faces each of the paler rosettes, holding a garland from which a flower springs and a leaf drops. Another garland hangs between them from their breasts, and from it depends the lozenge-shaped base on which they stand, with double loop and streamers below that. The ducks themselves are, as Stein observed, “admirably life-like”: their heads, breast-patches and tails are in orange-red, with the rest in yellow and white, and markings of the same indigo (described as “myrtle-green” by Stein) as the ground. By this variety and subtlety of markings, they are related to the other designs with pairs of ducks in the collection, such as the tiny but very bright ducks in the patchwork altar cloth and those of another fabric in the same patchwork (Pl. 9-7).</p><p>(41-6) The design in this fragment, which has a 3/1 twill on the front and plain weave on the back, is similar to that found on the printed fabric along the rear of a previous patchwork (see Pl. 9, No. 15). In the present piece, one row of spots is preserved almost completely: around the edge of each are eight trilobate petal shapes, alternately green and blue. The spots in alternate rows are incomplete but must have been lozenge-shaped with four instead of eight arms ending in similar trilobate petal shapes supported on volutes. More elaborate forms, as noted by Stein, appear in Chinese silver and in Chinese textiles in the Shoso-in, while ceiling patterns in the Tang caves at Dunhuang offer almost endless variations based on similar elements. Some of the closest comparisons can be made with Tang silks found at Astana (e.g., Sichou zhilu Pls. 43-44, from a tomb dated A.D. 778).</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>41－4 北朝時期（5～6世紀），其餘爲唐代（7～8世紀）</p><p>敦煌出土</p><p>經錦</p><p>41－1：4.2×4.0釐米……MAS872（Ch.00229）</p><p>41－2：41－1的背面</p><p>41－3：從左，4.3×6.7釐米，7.1×4.0釐米，2.9×4.0釐米</p><p>……MAS917（Ch.0026）</p><p>41－4：4.6×12.5釐米……MAS922（Ch.00178）</p><p>41－5：（上）長23.0釐米，（下）6.0×21.3釐米</p><p>……MAS918（Ch.0061.a）, MAS921（Ch.00165.b）</p><p>41－6：幅寬3.8釐米……MAS923（Ch.00297）</p><p>圖41－1和圖41－2分別是三角形小斷片的正反面。沿著垂直邊可看到極細的緯線（斯坦因把它當作了經線，確切的應該是緯線），經線使用比它粗的線。正面是三枚綾，反面是平織。因是斷片很小，不可能復原出它的整體纹樣。</p><p>圖41－3中展示的三件斷片，據斯坦因所記，是貼在有乾祐二年（949年）紀年的木版佛經冊裏的。但此錦本身不用說是早期織物，可能是古布的再利用。</p><p>圖案是以薩珊波斯風格的聯珠圓紋爲基礎，其中配有三個帶枝的方形花紋。左邊斷片的端脫落成鋸齒狀，但還能見到織邊，可以確認是經錦。</p><p>圖41－4是非常美的斷片，在敦煌發現的織物中，也僅次於圖37、圖38中所展示的經錦，可以說是非常早期的作品。斯坦因發現的三件斷片中，這裏展示的斷片是最大的，現收藏于大英博物館。面是綾織，反面是平織。</p><p>紋樣的基本結構，與人們所知的中國新疆地區出土的若干件早期的較大作品相似。其中之一，是1959年從吐魯番阿斯塔那303號墓（有推斷爲551年的墓誌）發掘出來的斷片，白、綠、青色帶紋上用紅色織出了樹紋。各種樹的中央用白色加了小的棋盤格紋，這與本圖斷片的各個花瓣上，以弓形排列的白色小方形的狀況相似。從吐魯番還發現了幾件有織邊的較大斷片（參照《文物精華》二）。斯坦因的記錄中，把花瓣紋稱作“心形”，那是織此錦並使用的人們的不同理解。花瓣基部使用了不同顔色，這裏的是隔行配着亮青色和紅色，據斯坦因的記述，別的斷片中還有綠色。</p><p>圖41－5上方的斷片，緯線是細而結實的淡紅色，而經線則是粗線（斯坦因的記述中細而結實的線是經線）。其圖案構成，從殘存的紋樣完全能推斷出，是由直徑約15釐米的大圓排成列，其間連接圓的四方形中配三葉紋的菱形紋樣。點紋的中心加了紅和淡綠，周圍用黃色做邊。其外側是用紅色和白色表現的三葉形花瓣，再外側是配了四個用黃色做邊的紅和淡綠的三葉紋。</p><p>圖41－5下方的斷片，是曾用作《西域》圖版LXII中展示的幡頭吊環。正面是三枚綾，反面則是平織，緯線的顔色像金色的柔和黃色。</p><p>圖案是交錯相配的藍色地上淡紅色和亮橙色的六瓣花的行列，其間加了帶花和莖的花飾，和面向淡紅色花的一對鳥。從鳥的胸部伸出另一花飾，鳥棲在從那花飾上吊下的菱形裝飾上，再其下是垂著蝴蝶結的飄帶裝飾。正如斯坦因記述的，鳥是“非常寫實”的，頭、胸部是斑點，尾巴是橙紅色，身體其他部分是用黃和白色來表現，眼睛和翅膀的線和底色一樣都用藍色（斯坦因記錄爲帶青色的深綠色）。此鳥極富變化的精妙表現，使人覺得與斯坦因收集的，如小片布拼成的《袈裟》（圖9）上所見的極小卻非常鮮亮的一對家鴨等織物圖樣中所見的鳥的若干圖案有密切關連。</p><p>41－6圖的斷片，正面爲四枚綾，反面是平織，其圖案設計與圖9《袈裟》後邊的夾纈染的圖案相似（參照同圖解說15）。紋樣恰好保留了一行大致完整的部分，大的花紋周圍，各自交叉排列著八個青和綠色的三瓣花。其上下行列的圖案幾乎未能保留下來，但從上行的殘部看，渦卷形的四方中配有相同的三瓣花的菱形紋樣。如斯坦因所述，使此圖案更具華麗形式的物品，見於正倉院傳下來的中國制銀器和染織品上。另外，敦煌唐代的天井畫紋樣上也有基本形式相同的各種圖案。再有，斯坦因發現的唐代絹中，也有許多件有極密切聯繫的作品（例如《絲綢之路》圖版43、44的，與大曆十三年（778年）的文書一同從381號墓出土的《變體寶相華紋錦》等）。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n=" Vol. 3 Plate 42-1"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.920</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Fragments of weft-patterned silks</title><title lang="chi-Hant">緯錦斷片</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 8 th- 9 th century A.D.</p><p>From Dunhuang</p><p>Weft- patterned compound double weave</p><p>42-1: (above)6.3×15.5 cm; (below left) 8.5×11.5 cm; (below right) H. 6.3 cm</p><p>42-2: 18.3×18.2 cm</p><p>42-3: 2.5×10.8 cm</p><p>42-4: reverse side of 42-3</p><p>42-5:3.4×7.4 cm</p><p>42-6: 7.5×10.5 cm</p><p>42-1:MAS 920 (Ch. 00172)</p><p>42-2:MAS 925 (Ch. 00227)</p><p>42-3:MAS 870 (Ch. 00177.a)</p><p>42-5:MAS 871 (Ch. 00174.a)</p><p>42-6:MAS 928 (Ch. 00180)</p><p>(42-1) These three pieces joined together probably formed the triangular headpiece of a banner.

Practically the whole of the pattern can be seen in the fragment: it consists of six- petalled rosettes, joined diagonally to those in the next rows by six-leaved stems, with small trefoils and lozenge-shaped rosettes in the spaces between.

Another fragment, Ch. 00362, which Stein considered to be probably part of the same textile, may be in New Delhi: it has the same light blue ground, and a floral spot in bright pink, green, yellow and white.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，8～9世紀</p><p>敦煌出土</p><p>緯錦</p><p>42－1：（上）6.3×15.5釐米，（左下）8.5×11.5釐米，（右下）長6.3釐米</p><p>……MAS920（Ch.00172）</p><p>42－2：18.3×18.2釐米……MAS925（Ch.00227）</p><p>42－3：2.5×10.8釐米……MAS870（Ch.00177.a）</p><p>42－4：42－3的反面</p><p>42－5：3.4×7.4釐米……MAS871（Ch.174.a）</p><p>42－6：7.5×10.5釐米……MAS928（Ch.00180）</p><p>圖42－1的三件斷片，可能原是縫在一起形成三角形的幡頭部分，稍大的兩片是相同材料，其圖案是以青色的圓爲中心，及向它飛的四隻鳥，之間分佈著青色花紋樣。小的斷片紋樣也類似，花稍大。雙方的紋樣都用青和白色做了邊。</p><p>在織法上，爲了織出紋樣使用暗經。看似平織，其實兩面都是綾織。最大的斷片的表面已經磨破，露出暗經線。</p><p>圖42－2的斷片，根據斯坦因的說法，可能曾用在垂幕（Ch.00278）上，是從上部分的絹帶上垂下的三角形垂飾之一。《西域》刊載的此垂幕圖版（參照PI,CIX）中，可清楚看到用相同的錦製作的另一垂飾，其花紋也和此斷片的花紋基本相同。六瓣的大花紋，空間呈菱形斜著連有六片葉子的莖，上下配有小的三葉紋及對邊形的小花紋。當初的花紋曾是淡紅色，白色做邊，比青色保留下來的好，但這些顔色褪色都很嚴重。</p><p>圖42－3和圖42－4，是同一斷片的正反面，兩面都是三枚綾。圖案設計是用青色鈎的飛翔姿勢的白色鳥，出現在花和葉子的紋樣間。</p><p>圖42－5的斷片，是四枚綾地上現出平織的紋樣，紋樣用漂亮顔色的緯線表現。緯線浮在背面，將紋樣結束處剪斷。織成的手感，如斯坦因所述，像緞紋刺繡。</p><p>圖42－6的小斷片，正反都是三枚綾，緯線粗經線細，使用細的紅色暗經。紋樣是白線上配著綠和黃色，並用紅線做了輪廓，可能是獅子。斯坦因說，現存於新德里國立博物館（Ch.00362）的，可能與此是同一塊錦的另一斷片，和這一樣，在亮青色地上散著鮮紅、綠、黃、白色小花。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n=" Vol. 3 Plate 43"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.905</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Headpiece of a banner</title><title lang="chi-Hant">幡頭</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 8th century A.D.</p><p>From Dunhuang</p><p>Painted silk and kesi tapestry</p><p>H.22.5 cm, W. 22.5 cm</p><p>MAS 905 (Ch. 0058)</p><p>This must have come from an extremely rich and sumptuous banner, as the borders are not assembled from fragments of plain silk, but are of kesi (kossu). The interior triangular piece of plain silk is painted with a large central flower and three other flowers in the corners, and the background between the flowers and foliage is filled in with blue. Only a fragment remains of the top of the banner, mainly consisting of a painted valance in stripes of orange and red, with narrower lines between. A tiny fragment of the actual painting shows a chocolate brown edge and yellow cartouche, rather similar to that seen in a banner with scenes of the life of the Buddha (Vol. 1, Pl. 30) and its companion in New Delhi (Ch. lv. 0010). The painted valance is also similar to that seen in another banner (Vol. 1, Pl. 38), which, like the former, has scenes from the life of the Buddha.</p><p>The kesi borders are the full width (2.7 cm) as originally woven with alternating full spots in the centre of the strip and pairs of half-spots along the edges. They have approximately 60 Z- ply warp threads. At the centre of each of the full spots is a small bird, perhaps a duckling, in a contrasting colour, brown or white or blue, with beak and feet in another colour again. A similar headpiece is attached to the banner of a Bodhisattva in Indian style (Ch. lv.0034; Serindia, Pls. LXXX and CVI) using the same tapestry-woven strip. A strip of paper covered with gold leaf is woven in as an elongated spot in each of the green petals, and the four buds (striped in brown, blue and white) are also edged with gold-leafed paper strips.</p><p>The uniquely Chinese technique of kesi (kossu) tapestry must have furnished the most precious of the fabrics found at Dunhuang. As seen in Pl. 6, it was used sparingly in very narrow strips to adorn the central panel of sutra wrappers, or as here to make up the headpieces of a matching set of banners of the highest quality.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，8世紀</p><p>敦煌出土</p><p>彩畫·緙絲（錦）</p><p>高22.5釐米 幅寬22.5釐米</p><p>MAS905（Ch.0058）</p><p>從此幡頭的絹邊不是綴集了平絹斷片，而是使用了緙絲（錦）這一點看，它也是一件極盡奢華的幡的一部分。中心部位的三角形平絹上，繪著中央一朵大花，三角處各有一朵小花的畫，地用青色填滿。幡身的上端也殘留下來，在紅和橙色的縞上都加了細線繪的垂幕。其下仍殘留著一點點繪畫邊緣上的深褐色框和黃色題記框，其結構與第1卷圖30的《佛傳圖幡》以及和它成對的新德里國立博物館的幡（Ch.lv.0010）非常相似。垂幕的繪畫也和第1卷圖38等其他佛傳圖幡相似，這一點也可證明，此幡頭是繪有佛傳圖幡的一部分。</p><p>錦原是在此使用的幅面（2.7釐米）上，交叉織出中心部位的一個單位的紋樣和從兩旁派生出的一對半花紋。中心的紋樣帶中，似家鴨的小鳥配合背景的變化，以對照性的茶、白、青等色出現，在嘴和腳上還加了其他顔色。同樣有織錦邊的幡頭，還可見於印度式菩薩像的幡（參照Ch.lv.0034.《西域》圖版LXXX以及CVI）中。綠色的花瓣形狀中用金絲（用金箔卷的細紙）織出的細長線，四個花蕾（茶青、白色的縞）也有金絲的邊。</p><p>錦仅在中國獨自得到發展，在敦煌的各種出土物中，也是用在最高貴的物品上。正如圖8中所見的，作裝飾經帙中心部位的細帶子，或者像本圖一樣，僅少量的配在最高級的幡畫上的幡頭作絹邊。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n=" Vol. 3 Plate 44-1"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.906</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Fragments of kesi</title><title lang="chi-Hant">緙絲斷片</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 8th century A.D.</p><p>From Dunhuang</p><p>Silk tapestry</p><p>Second piece from left: L.9.0 cm</p><p>From left: MAS 906 (Ch. 00166; two fragments),</p><p>MAS 908 (Ch. 00301; two fragments), MAS 907 (Ch. 00300; single fragment)</p><p>Despite their small size, all of these fragments of kesi tapestry are the full width as originally woven.

In the British Museum piece, the carving is slightly more detailed, and the drapery forms show a typical Tang concern for plastic form. In addition, there are abundant remains of the original colouring in red and black.

Of the new acquisitions, 570 were manuscripts, placed by Wang inside two large boxes in his storeroom and so not taken with the remainder of the contents of Cave 17 to Beijing. After negotiating their sale, Wang presented Stein with a small collection of stucco plaques, which Wang said he had found loose in the sand, but which Stein felt came from a frieze in one of the caves near the centre of the site.</p><p>This small moulded plaque, painted and quite richly gilt, was one of these late acquisitions. Others are known, for example in the Pelliot collection, and these are so close as to have probably come from the same location. The monk, appropriately for a representation which may have been placed outside, wears his robe in the covering mode, serving as a hood around the face, and closely tucked around the neck. The hands and feet are quite hidden. The robe has gilded edges, and is further ornamented with floral motifs, one on top of the head and the others scattered over the robe. From the simplified representation and particularly the proportions of the large head and upper body in contrast to the rather diminutive shape presented by the hidden knees, one imagines that this is a work of the late Tang or even later.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，9～10世紀</p><p>敦煌出土</p><p>彩色塗金的模壓</p><p>高28.4釐米 寬17.7釐米</p><p>1928 10－22 26（Ch.031）</p><p>斯坦因再訪敦煌，是在第三次探險時的1914年4月，儘管在他上次訪問後伯希和等其他人也曾探訪這裏，裝了六輛貨車的文書類經卷，通過官方之手，也已運至北京，但此次他還是從王道士手中得到了很多物品。新收集品中有570件是文書，是藏經洞收藏的物品運至北京後的剩餘部分，王道士裝了兩大箱藏起來的。這次交易結束後，王道士贈送給斯坦因幾個半身塑像。據王道士說，那些是散亂在沙漠中被他發現的，而斯坦因認爲，是構成近於遺迹中央石窟的一個柱子中楣的塑像。</p><p>此彩色塗金的模壓浮雕像，如上所述，是後來增添的收集品中的一件。其他還有如伯希和的收集品等，是從同一場所攜來的。此僧像的樣子，好像是在戶外，用衣服緊緊裹住身體，用頭巾似的東西圍住頭，並下垂遮住衣襟，手腳完全被遮蓋。衣服用金彩做邊，花紋樣的裝飾，除頭上有一個外，還散落在衣服上。從簡略化的表現，頭和上半身較大，對比之下，衣服遮掩的膝蓋又顯得很小等方面看，可考慮這是晚唐或者更晚時期製作的。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n=" Vol. 3 Plate 48"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.627</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Colossal head of the Buddha</title><title lang="chi-Hant">雕塑佛頭</title><note lang="eng"><p>5th century A.D.</p><p>From Miran</p><p>Stucco</p><p>H. 54.0 cm</p><p>British Museum, MAS 627 (M. Ⅱ.007)</p><p>The remains of the Miran vihara M. Ⅱ, as described by Stein (Serindia, Vol. I, p. 487), consisted of a solid mound of sun-dried bricks, in two storeys, with a base 46 by 36 feet (about 13.8 by 10.8 m) and a second storey, badly decayed, 17 by 15 2/1 feet (5.1 by 4.65m). A passage about 10 feet (3 m) wide enclosed the central portion of the shrine, and was lined along the outer wall with a row of colossal seated images of the Buddha, each measuring 7 feet to 7 feet 3 inches (about 2.1m) across the knees, and all in dhyana-mudra. Of these only the bases, hands and legs were preserved, but the head seen here had been protected through falling into the space, wider at the back than at the front, between two of these figures. It originally belonged to the third of five figures uncovered by Stein.</p><p>Although the head itself evidently cannot provide a firm basis for dating, evidence of various kinds noted by Stein leads to the date given here. The drapery over the knees of the figures was arranged as at Gandhara, with three concentric folds falling from the hands. The folds on two of the statues were in the form of boldly raised plaits about an inch (2.5cm) wide and on the other three, including this one, as narrow double grooves. There were traces of red colour, similar to the statues from Rawak. Further evidence came from the shape of the Indo-Persian stucco pilasters around the vihara base. These also show Gandharan features and must have taken time to develop into the forms seen later at Endere and Khadalik. Probably the most conclusive evidence for the dating of the Miran vihara is provided by the finding of a palm leaf pothi in Sanskrit, written in Brahmi characters of an early Gupta type, which cannot be later than the fifth century A.D., and by the corresponding absence of any relics of Tibetan writing (in contrast to Endere and Khadalik, where Tibetan documents were found in abundance).</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>5世紀</p><p>米蘭出土</p><p>高54.0釐米</p><p>大英博物館,MAS627（M.II.007）</p><p>據斯坦因記述（參照《西域》487頁），米蘭寺院遺迹的第Ⅱ寺址是用曬乾的磚建造的結實的兩層建築物，第一層爲13.8m×10.8m，第二層爲5.1m×4.65m。正殿中心部分圍有寬3米的回廊，沿其外壁，排列著約有2.1米的巨大坐佛，手結定印。現還殘留著那些台座、手、腳。而本圖所示的頭部，不是在像與像間的前方，而是落在空間稍寬的後方，才得以保留下來。這是斯坦因發掘的五身當中的第三尊。</p><p>佛頭本身沒有任何提示確切年代的證據，但從斯坦因所記述的以下種種特徵，能夠推算它的年代。即蓋在佛像膝蓋上的衣紋線，是從兩手垂下的三條衣褶的集合點，此是犍陀羅式的。佛像其中的兩身上約有2.5釐米寬的粗褶子，包括本像在內的三身像上，有兩條狹窄的溝狀褶子，殘留著與熱瓦克出土的塑像群相似的紅色痕迹等。另外，更明確的證據是，還可舉出圍繞寺院部位的印度、波斯風格的灰泥壁柱形狀。它們具備犍陀羅的特徵，後又向安得悅和喀達里克見到的形式發展的。對米蘭寺院遺迹的年代判斷上，最具決定性的證據是，梵文貝葉的發現。那是用笈多王朝早期的婆羅謎文寫的，不可能晚於5世紀以後。另外，從完全沒有發現吐蕃文資料這一點上也應得到證實（與安得悅和喀達里克發現大量吐蕃文書形成對比）。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 49"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.611.b</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Scale-armour</title><title lang="chi-Hant">革制及氈制鎧甲小鱗片</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 8th- 9th century A.D.</p><p>From Miran and Niya (49-5, three unlacquered leather scales)</p><p>Leather, lacquered and carved</p><p>49-1: (above) 7.0×15.6 cm; (below) 11.0×19.5 cm</p><p>49-2: 15.5×21.2 cm</p><p>49-3:8.0×17.5 cm</p><p>49-4: 9.6×28.2 cm</p><p>49-5: (from left) H. 8.2 cm, 6.7 cm, 6.0 cm, 8.7 cm</p><p>49-1: British Museum, MAS 611 (M.I.ix.003)</p><p>49-2: British Museum, MAS 621 (M.I.xxiv.0040)</p><p>49-3: British Museum, MAS 610 (M.I.ix.002)</p><p>49-4: British Museum, MAS 592 (M.I.0069)</p><p>49-5: British Museum, MAS 567 (N.V.xv.004)</p><p>49-5: British Museum, MAS 526 (N.V.xv.0011), (N.xv. 005)</p><p>49-5: British Museum, MAS 616 (M.I.xiv.0074)</p><p>Scale-armour made of lacquered leather scales is unique to China, and recent excavations have demonstrated that from ancient times until the Warring States period such armour was the principal type in use, although scales of bronze and iron have been found. Traces of painted leather scales were discovered in a Shang tomb at Anyang, while examples from the Zhou dynasty are numerous. The Zuozhuan provides literary evidence of the use of buffalo, rhinoceros and wild ox hide, as well as recording the use of red lacquer as well as recording the use of red lacquer as a protective or ornamental coating. These and other forms of scale-armour (such as bronze and iron) have been fully discussed by Yang Hong (Zhongguo gubingqi luncong, Beijing 1980,p.3ff).</p><p>The other scales shown here were found by Stein on his second expedition. The unlacquered ones were again from Niya, and the rest from the Tibetan fort at Miran, a site about two kilometres to the south-west of the temples where he had found the colossal head shown in the previous plate. The construction of the fort began at a time when the earlier temples had been completely abandoned. According to Stein, “everything pointed to the conclusion that the structural remains of the ruined fort and the deep deposits of rubbish ... all belonged to a protracted period of Tibetan occupation which in the light of available historical evidence could safely be assigned to the eighth or ninth century A.D.” (Serindia, Vol. I, pp. 348-49). In all, Stein found a total of some sixty-odd scales of armour: all of those now in the British Museum are illustrated here. They have aroused considerable interest not only as actual examples of the scale-armour seen on many of the Guardian Kings depicted in paintings from Dunhuang, and modelled in clay on stucco figurines from other Central Asian sites (see Pl. 98), but because they also appear to be the earliest examples of carved lacquer.</p><p>As may be seen from the Niya examples, the leather itself used of the scales was tough and thick enough to be extremely resistant to penetration. The addition of lacquer further provided a smoother surface even more likely to deflect a blow. The total thickness of lacquer added (for instance in Pl. 49-3, where there are several bands of black and reddish brown) comes to about a millimetre, and Sir Harry Garner has estimated that there between twenty and thirty layers within this thickness (Chinese Lacquer, p. 68). Two or more layers of each colour were applied in turn to make up each band. The bands of colour were exposed again by carving at a shallow angle. As is most clearly seen in Pl. 49-2, the concentric or comma-shaped designs so produced were sometimes enhanced by built-up ridges. On the back, the scales were also lacquered, but there was of course no decoration. Some of the scales are also ornamented with bronze rivets.</p><p>Sir Harry Garner has drawn attention to the importance of this type of decoration on armour for the history of carved lacquer, since the necessary thickness of lacquer encouraged carved decoration in a way that would not have been possible with the thinner coating that was sufficient for most decorative pieces. From the record in the Zuozhuan, it would appear however, that xipi originally referred to the use of actual rhinoceros hide for scale-armour. The rhinoceros was part of the North Chinese fauna in the Shang dynasty, and the capture of it is refetted to in the oracle-bone records, while in ritual bronzes it appears both as one of the horned animals common on Shang vessels, and occasionally as a rhinoceros zun, or wine vessel, extremely life-like. There can be no doubt that the tough hide was used for armour, and that its use, probably in association with the techniques of lacquering and carving, was sufficiently established to ensure the survival of the term xipi for carved lacquer long after the rhinoceros had moved south. The material of which the Stein armour scales are made has not been identified with certainty, although it has been suggested that it may be camel skin. The unlacquered examples from Niya, however, do not appear to show the strong furrowing that is characteristic of camel skin (cf. Ronald Reed, [1972], Fig. 3, p. 286). Other armour scales found in the Xinjiang region have included examples made of iron and bronze.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，8～9世紀</p><p>米蘭和尼雅出土</p><p>49－1：（上）7.0×15.6釐米，（下）11.0×19.5釐米</p><p>49－4：大英博物館,MAS611（M.I.ix.003）</p><p>49－2：15.5×21.2釐米</p><p>49－4：大英博物館,AS621（M.I.xxiv.0040）</p><p>49－3：8.0×17.5釐米</p><p>49－4：大英博物館,MAS610（M.I.ix.002）</p><p>49－4：9.6×28.2釐米</p><p>49－4：大英博物館,MAS592（M.I.0069）</p><p>49－5：從左，高8.2釐米，6.7釐米，6.0釐米，8.7釐米</p><p>49－5：大英博物館,MAS567（N.V.xv.004）,</p><p>49－5：大英博物館,MAS 526(N.V.xv.0011), (N.xv. 005)</p><p>49－5：大英博物館,MAS 616 (M.I.xiv.0074)</p><p>革製塗漆的鎧甲小鱗片是中國獨有的，根據近年的發掘，才發現有用青銅或鐵製作的，證明自戰國時代以前就使用以這種形狀爲主的鎧甲。從安陽的商代墓中也發現過一些彩繪革製鱗片，到了周代這樣的例證更多。在《左傳》中就有關於使用水牛或犀牛、野牛等皮革的記載，另外還有爲保護或裝飾而使用紅漆的記載。楊泓的論文（《中國古兵器論著》北京1980年，3頁以後）中，除詳細介紹本圖中所刊載的鎧甲外，還詳述了其他鎧甲小鱗片（青銅製或鐵製等）。</p><p>本圖展示的鎧甲鱗片，是斯坦因發現的多件小鱗片中，收藏于大英博物館的部分，有關小片鎧甲的第一手考古學資料，正如以下所述的，作爲雕漆的最早範例，在今天受到極大重視。</p><p>本圖所揭示的鱗片中最小的一片(圖49-5)，是斯坦因第一次探險時在尼雅發現的，刊載於《古代和田（Ancient Khotan）》中。斯坦因考證此綠色皮革小片是鎧甲的鱗片，通過與吐蕃鎖鎧的比較，很容易得到證實。那吐蕃鎖鎧上，鱗片有帶子的圓形的一端有一個，兩側分別有三個洞。有關穿帶子的方法，在附載於《古代和田》的F.H. Andrews展示的圖解（參照同書第1卷序文16頁），有圓形一端的帶子的展示。</p><p>這裏展示的其他鱗片，是斯坦因第二次探險時發現的。未塗漆的鱗片也是在尼雅發現的，其餘則是在米蘭吐蕃要塞中發現的。那些要塞是在斯坦因發現圖48佛頭的寺院遺址向西南約2.5公里的地方，建造於完全廢棄的佛寺遺址上。斯坦因叙述“對從要塞遺址或废棄場地發現的遺物的年代，可以完全下結論是8世紀到9世紀的，殘留著濃厚的受吐蕃佔領時期影響的色彩”（參照《西域》第1卷，348～149頁）。斯坦因發現的鎧甲鱗片總計達六十餘個，而現存于大英博物館的，已在這裏全部展示了。這些是敦煌繪畫中描繪的衆多的天王像，或中亞各地出土的土製泥像上所見的鎧甲鱗片的實物(見圖 98)，不僅如此，還在作爲漆上雕刻花紋的最早的範例這一點上，也是有很深的意義。</p><p>Harry Garner提醒注意，在雕漆歷史中，有關鎧甲的這種裝飾所佔的重要性。即，普通的裝飾品只塗很薄的漆即可，而鎧甲的鱗片要求要厚，可以說漆的厚度，使薄塗層不可能用的雕刻裝飾技法成爲可能。《左傳》記載的“犀皮”這個詞，本來是指小鱗片鎧甲是用犀牛皮做的。犀牛，商代時期棲息在中國北部，甲骨文中有關於捕獲它的記載。並且，祭祀用的青銅器，商代的器物中也有有角獸形像的，還發現了犀牛形狀的尊，也就是酒器，栩栩如生。結實的犀牛皮被使用在鎧甲上，並採取了塗漆和雕漆等技法，這無疑是在犀牛遷徙到南方之後。但這可能是“犀皮”一詞原封不動地用以表示雕漆的意思，並流傳至今的原因。斯坦因收集的鎧甲鱗片的材質現在還不清楚，但一直認爲是駱駝革。然而，尼雅出土的沒有塗漆的鱗片，也不見有駱駝皮特徵的深皺紋（參照Ronald Reed《古代皮革·羊皮紙和鞣皮》，1972,Fig,3,p.286）。除了這種革製的外，新疆地區發現的鎧甲鱗片中，還有用鐵或銅製作的。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 49-2"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.621</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Scale-armour</title><title lang="chi-Hant">革制及氈制鎧甲小鱗片</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 8th- 9th century A.D.</p><p>From Miran and Niya (49-5, three unlacquered leather scales)</p><p>Leather, lacquered and carved</p><p>49-1: (above) 7.0×15.6 cm; (below) 11.0×19.5 cm</p><p>49-2: 15.5×21.2 cm</p><p>49-3:8.0×17.5 cm</p><p>49-4: 9.6×28.2 cm</p><p>49-5: (from left) H. 8.2 cm, 6.7 cm, 6.0 cm, 8.7 cm</p><p>49-1: British Museum, MAS 611 (M.I.ix.003)</p><p>49-2: British Museum, MAS 621 (M.I.xxiv.0040)</p><p>49-3: British Museum, MAS 610 (M.I.ix.002)</p><p>49-4: British Museum, MAS 592 (M.I.0069)</p><p>49-5: British Museum, MAS 567 (N.V.xv.004)</p><p>49-5: British Museum, MAS 526 (N.V.xv.0011), (N.xv. 005)</p><p>49-5: British Museum, MAS 616 (M.I.xiv.0074)</p><p>Scale-armour made of lacquered leather scales is unique to China, and recent excavations have demonstrated that from ancient times until the Warring States period such armour was the principal type in use, although scales of bronze and iron have been found.

Traces of painted leather scales were discovered in a Shang tomb at Anyang, while examples from the Zhou dynasty are numerous. The Zuozhuan provides literary evidence of the use of buffalo, rhinoceros and wild ox hide, as well as recording the use of red lacquer as well as recording the use of red lacquer as a protective or ornamental coating. These and other forms of scale-armour (such as bronze and iron) have been fully discussed by Yang Hong (Zhongguo gubingqi luncong, Beijing 1980,p.3ff).</p><p>The other scales shown here were found by Stein on his second expedition. The unlacquered ones were again from Niya, and the rest from the Tibetan fort at Miran, a site about two kilometres to the south-west of the temples where he had found the colossal head shown in the previous plate. The construction of the fort began at a time when the earlier temples had been completely abandoned. According to Stein, “everything pointed to the conclusion that the structural remains of the ruined fort and the deep deposits of rubbish ... all belonged to a protracted period of Tibetan occupation which in the light of available historical evidence could safely be assigned to the eighth or ninth century A.D.” (Serindia, Vol. I, pp. 348-49). In all, Stein found a total of some sixty-odd scales of armour: all of those now in the British Museum are illustrated here. They have aroused considerable interest not only as actual examples of the scale-armour seen on many of the Guardian Kings depicted in paintings from Dunhuang, and modelled in clay on stucco figurines from other Central Asian sites (see Pl. 98), but because they also appear to be the earliest examples of carved lacquer.</p><p>As may be seen from the Niya examples, the leather itself used of the scales was tough and thick enough to be extremely resistant to penetration. The addition of lacquer further provided a smoother surface even more likely to deflect a blow. The total thickness of lacquer added (for instance in Pl. 49-3, where there are several bands of black and reddish brown) comes to about a millimetre, and Sir Harry Garner has estimated that there between twenty and thirty layers within this thickness (Chinese Lacquer, p. 68). Two or more layers of each colour were applied in turn to make up each band. The bands of colour were exposed again by carving at a shallow angle. As is most clearly seen in Pl. 49-2, the concentric or comma-shaped designs so produced were sometimes enhanced by built-up ridges. On the back, the scales were also lacquered, but there was of course no decoration. Some of the scales are also ornamented with bronze rivets.</p><p>Sir Harry Garner has drawn attention to the importance of this type of decoration on armour for the history of carved lacquer, since the necessary thickness of lacquer encouraged carved decoration in a way that would not have been possible with the thinner coating that was sufficient for most decorative pieces. From the record in the Zuozhuan, it would appear however, that xipi originally referred to the use of actual rhinoceros hide for scale-armour. The rhinoceros was part of the North Chinese fauna in the Shang dynasty, and the capture of it is refetted to in the oracle-bone records, while in ritual bronzes it appears both as one of the horned animals common on Shang vessels, and occasionally as a rhinoceros zun, or wine vessel, extremely life-like. There can be no doubt that the tough hide was used for armour, and that its use, probably in association with the techniques of lacquering and carving, was sufficiently established to ensure the survival of the term xipi for carved lacquer long after the rhinoceros had moved south.

The rhinoceros was part of the North Chinese fauna in the Shang dynasty, and the capture of it is refetted to in the oracle-bone records, while in ritual bronzes it appears both as one of the horned animals common on Shang vessels, and occasionally as a rhinoceros zun, or wine vessel, extremely life-like.

The material of which the Stein armour scales are made has not been identified with certainty, although it has been suggested that it may be camel skin. The unlacquered examples from Niya, however, do not appear to show the strong furrowing that is characteristic of camel skin (cf. Ronald Reed, [1972], Fig. 3, p. 286).

Much of the contents was stable refuse, but there were also sweepings from the nearby buildings of the station. The wooden documents found in it, mainly in Chinese, have been studied by Chavannes (1913) and Maspero (1953); some documents in Karosthi and one in Sogdian script were also found. The dates of the Chinese wooden documents were all between A.D. 264 and A.D. 270, with one paper document dated A.D. 312. As Stein recognized, this rather narrow band of dates in the late third and early fourth centuries gave a special archaeological value to the objects, such as pottery sherds with incised decoration, found in the pit.</p><p>This fragment of rug is very similar in appearance and colouring to other pieces excavated at Niya in 1959 (see Sichou zhilu, Pl. 12 and Xinjiang chutu wenwu, Pl. 33). Both the Niya fragments, although different in colouring, show a division of the design by straight blue or black lines into lozenges or parallelograms. The Stein fragment apparently shows an edge of the main field, with a border of straight lines and interlocking designs on a red ground. The design would seem to be influenced by contemporary silk fabrics in the adoption of the lozenge pattern, of interlocking lines, and of the edging of the blue lines here in white.</p><p>As described by Stein (Serindia, Vol. I, p. 438), the “warp [is] of thin brown string, [the] weft, four picks of loosely twisted yarn, well packed; [and the] pile, a soft woolen yarn, four-ply, c. 1″ long, turned twice round each ‘end’ of warp forming a very firm knot .... On [the] back, at intervals of five picks of weft, are rows of long woolen tufts. Each tuft consists of two soft woollen yarns very slightly twisted and c. 5″ [12.5 cm] in length, slipped under every tenth ‘end’ of warp, no knot being tied and the two ends floating free. The object of these may have been to prevent the carpet’s slipping on a smooth floor.” Stein noted the similarity of the technique to that of modern Japanese rugs, in which however, the tufts on the back were no longer present.</p><p>Another fragment of carpet with tufts on the back, found by Stein at Loulan on his return there in 1914, is illustrated by Yamanobe Tomoyuki (1981, Pl. 69). Stein thought that these and other fragments of woolen pile carpet found at Loulan were the products of local industry in the Tarim Basin (Innermost Asia, Vol. I, p.232).</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>3世紀末～4世紀初</p><p>樓蘭出土</p><p>羊毛</p><p>33.0×31.5釐米</p><p>MAS693（L.A.VI.ii.0046）</p><p>斯坦因名爲L.A.VI.ii的遺迹，是漢代駐屯地的廣闊垃圾場。發掘品大多是廐舍的廢棄物，但也混雜著一些從附近的建築物出土的廢品。在這裏主要的發現是很多寫漢文的木簡，沙畹（1913年）和馬伯樂（1953年）出了研究那些木簡的書。還發現了幾件佉盧文書和一件粟特文的文書。漢文木簡的年代均爲264年至270年間的，紙本的一件上有312年（西晉永嘉六年）的記載。如斯坦因也敍述的，這些木簡類的年代，僅限於3世紀後半葉至4世紀初這段相當短的時間內，這對於同時發掘的有刻文的陶片類等來說，提供了特殊的考古學價值。</p><p>此毛毯斷片外觀和色彩，與1959年從尼雅發現的斷片類非常相似（參照《絲綢之路》圖版12及《新疆出土文物》圖版33）。上述兩件尼雅斷片，色彩搭配稍有不同，但都是用青和黑色線隔開的菱形和平行四邊形圖案。本圖的斷片是大毛毯的邊緣部分，可見到一部分筆直的邊線，和顯現在紅色地上的一部分複雜文樣的主要內容。哪一部分設計都受到同時期絹織物的影響，用繁雜的線表現菱形紋樣，用青色線作邊，而本圖的斷片使用了白色。</p><p>據斯坦因的記述（參照《西域》438頁），“經線爲細的茶色帶，緯線是撚得較松的四股線，編織孔緊密。形成絨面的四股撚成的柔軟毛線，在經線的邊緣纏繞兩回，成爲結實的扣。背面可見每隔五根緯線有一排長毛線穗。各穗長約12.5釐米，由略撚過的兩種軟毛線組成，並穿過每十根經線之下，沒有打結，兩端的任何一方都可移動。其穗的作用是鋪墊在光滑的床上也不會滑落”。斯坦因還注意到與日本近代鋪墊物技法的相似性，背面做穗的作法，現在已經不盛行了。</p><p>1914年，斯坦因在回來的路上從樓蘭發現的，背面有穗的另一毛毯碎片，被刊載於山邊知行先生的『シルグロ－ドの染織』中。斯坦因認爲這些毛毯，還有從樓蘭發現的長毛織的鋪墊物斷片類，是塔里木盆地區出産的（參照《亞洲腹地》 “Innermost Asia”232頁）。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 51-1"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.719</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Fragments of architectural decoration</title><title lang="chi-Hant">浮雕裝飾建築材料斷片</title><note lang="eng"><p>Han dynasty (206 B.C.-A.D. 220)</p><p>From Loulan</p><p>Carved poplar wood</p><p>Left: L. 38.7 cm, W.8.0 cm</p><p>Right: L. 41.0 cm, W. 9.2 cm</p><p>MAS 719 (L.

The fourth piece is also from Khadalik, but its exact position on the site is not known. The site was abandoned towards the end of the eighth century, as established by Stein from finds of coins at the site (see Serindia, Vol. I, p. 159).</p><p>Although the figure of Ganesa is somewhat coarsely drawn, the other figures are finely delineated. The head of the Buddha in particular may be compared to a larger fragment (see Serindia, Pl. XI, Kha. i. C. 0097) from the centre of the shrine. Although this larger fragment, which is still in the British Museum, has suffered considerably since its reproduction by Stein, the plate in Serindia shows both the splendour of the original composition and the way in which it was related to small seated figures of the Buddha, alternating in background colour. The Buddha is seated with hands in the teaching mudra; his lotus throne has two rows of fleshy petals, symmetrically disposed. Behind him is a mandorla of stylized flames. On either side stand tall Bodhisattvas, swaying at the waist slightly towards the Buddha, the legs very stiff and straight. Their form is close to that of the individual Bodhisattvas of Vol. 1, Pls. 46-48, and the stance recurs much later in most of the paintings found by Kozlov at Kharakhoto and now in the Hermitage Museum, Leningrad (cf. Dieux et demons de l’ Himalaya, Nos.22-23, p. 77ff). Small seated Buddhas, all with their heads slightly inclined in three-quarters view, surround the whole composition, which thus appears as a Buddha triad on a ground of regularly alternating smaller figures, on a smaller scale but with the same organization as that to be found in the Sui and Tang caves at Dunhuang. Joanna Williams (1973,p. 110) has pointed out how important this fragment is, since it “connects a variety of types of image which are usually preserved only in fragments.”</p><p>This well-moulded head, almost life-size and with sharply defined features, was one of a number (see also Fig. 134) found in a shrine slightly apart from the rest and raised on a high-walled terrace, whose brickwork was strengthened with layers of reeds. The interior of the shrine was completely filled with hard-burned debris, and Stein only had time to effect a partial clearance around the entrance. No trace was found of the bodies belonging to this or to other similar heads, all close in style to those found in nearby ruins (x-xii). Stein’s explanation was that the bodies were insufficiently fired in the conflagration that destroyed the temple, but another observation should perhaps be made here. Although reports from other sites (cf. Toumchouq, 1964, Vol. Ⅱ, p. 142) confirm that the material used was generally clay mixed with some fibre, it seems probable that the heads, moulded and fashioned separately, could have been hardened in the open, before being fitted to the bodies which, being necessarily modelled in situ, remained softer and more vulnerable. This might account for the preservation of so many finely detailed heads. As noted in the description of the tile seen in Pl. 112, Stein himself ventured the possibility of an actual firing of some pieces, besides the hardening and loss of colour during the destruction of the shrines.</p><p>Another sizeable fragment, Kha. i. E. 0058. c, unfortunately not reproduced here or in Serindia, has four of the small Buddhas with colours well preserved: white and red alternate in the mandorlas and ground, with occasional nimbi or mandorlas of purplish pink, while the Buddha’s robe may be red, black brown or white. Each is seated on a flat-topped padmasana with down-turned petals. The main facial features are outlined in red, but the pupils, upper eyelids and eyebrows are in ink. The two small fragments shown in Fig. 42 are of this type. (Figure 49, though a wooden plaque and not a wall painting, shows the correct angle at which the head was inclined; a single larger head, Kha. i. 0054,is reproduced in Serindia, Pl. XI.) The few drapery lines are in ink and occasionally accented in white, but on the whole the painters seem to have preferred the use of areas of colour without outline, so that the figures have a simple solidity. No lines are ruled between the Buddhas, the frame for each being established by the simple counterchange of colours in the ground.</p><p>Among the other fragments shown in the monochrome figures, Fig. 44 displays brilliant colours: the bodhisattva, presumably Avalokitesvara since he holds a flask, wears azure trousers; his body, outlined in red, is pink against a bright green mandorla with broad brown and red borders. The small figure nearby appears to be a donor. Plate 53-4 shows some of the same blue, less brilliant in reproduction than in the original, combined with delicate outlines and subtle green and pink shades, in a fragment of the Cosmic Vairocana with the sun disc on his shoulder and a vajra on the forearm (cf. Pl. 72 and Figs. 50, 95). Such pieces afford a mere glimpse of the wealth and quality of Khotanese painting, and it is interesting that one fragment (Fig. 43) shows a hand grasping a writing brush: the handle is of wood, with a close binding and slightly swelling bundle of hairs at the end.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>6世紀</p><p>喀達里克出土</p><p>53－1：高9.4釐米 寬11.0釐米</p><p>53－1：斯坦因繪畫271（Kha.i.E.0048）</p><p>53－2：高16.8釐米 寬16.0釐米</p><p>53－2：斯坦因繪畫268（Kha.i.C.0095）</p><p>53－3：高11.5釐米 寬10.0釐米</p><p>53－3：斯坦因繪畫275（Kha.i.E.0065）</p><p>53－4：高15.0釐米 寬10.0釐米</p><p>53－4：斯坦因繪畫261（Kha.0026）</p><p>參照Figs.42－48</p><p>智慧神像有幾分粗劣，其他諸像描繪的相當精細。特別是佛頭可與該寺址中央位置發現的大斷片（參照《西域》圖版XI， Kha.l.C.0097）相比較。斯坦因將大斷片收錄在《西域》的圖版內，當時看來破損嚴重，故本書未收錄。看《西域》圖版，就會發現當初極壯觀的構圖，以及有規則地配置小佛坐像、背景顔色變換等技法。中尊佛兩手結說法印，結跏趺坐在蓮華座上，蓮花座由兩層豐滿蓮瓣對稱排列而成，背後是模式化曼陀羅火焰紋的背光。左右有長身的菩薩，腰略傾向佛立著，其腿筆直僵硬。此菩薩的姿態，與本書第1卷圖46-48的諸菩薩像，以及科茲洛夫發現于黑水城現存於艾爾米塔什美術館，時代稍晚的繪畫（參照《喜瑪拉亞的神與魔》，圖22、23，頁77）中所見的相似。</p><p>這些主尊群的周圍，配有略向前傾的小佛坐像，這看來恰似佛三尊突出在有規則地分配小佛像的背景中。此小佛群，規模雖小，但讓人想起敦煌隋唐窟中所見千佛的結構。Joanna Williams也指出，此斷片的重要性，就在於各個零七八碎很難拼合的斷片上，能看出像與像間的相互關係（參照《和田佛教美術的圖像》，1973，110頁）。</p><p>此外，《西域》中沒有收錄，遺憾的是本書選材時也遺漏了的，還有色彩保存較好的四身小佛的略大些的斷片Kha.i.E.0058.c。那斷片上，身光和底色交替搭配著白和紅色，紅色時而在頭光上，時而又用在身光上。而佛的衣服爲紅、黑、茶、白等色，都坐在平坦的覆瓣蓮花座上。臉部的主要部分用朱線描繪，瞼和眉毛使用了黑色。Fig. 42展示的兩塊斷片與此是同類作品（收錄於《西域》圖版XI的繪有佛頭的斷片Kha.i.0054，也是與此同類的作品。另外，本書Fig. 49，雖然是板繪而不是壁畫，但前側向的臉部表現與此相同）。衣紋線使用黑色，偶爾用白色來突出，大概是畫家比較喜歡省略輪廓線而以色面來表現，佛像具有一點立體感。各小佛坐像間沒有分界線，只是調換每個像框的底色來體現。</p><p>黑白圖版展示的壁畫斷片中，Fig. 44可見有美麗的色彩：從手持淨瓶判斷是觀音菩薩，身著淡青色衣裙，有紅色輪廓的肉身上染了淡紅色，與有茶和紅色寬邊的亮綠色背光形成鮮明的對比。近處的小像可能是供養人。圖53－4中，可見精細的輪廓線和淡紅的暈染，有美麗的淡綠和青的色彩。一個斷片為肩有日輪、前臂有金剛的毗盧遮那佛(參見圖72 及 Figs. 50, 95)，從這些壁畫的斷片，可窺到和田壁畫的興盛及其品質的一端，而描繪著手握毛筆的一個斷片(Fig. 43)也是饒有意義的。那筆的桿是木製的，略有些蓬鬆的毛束被牢固地捆在一起。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 53-2"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.268</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Fragments of wall painting</title><title lang="chi-Hant">佛頭雕塑</title><note lang="eng"><p>Ca. 6th century A.

Joanna Williams (1973,p. 110) has pointed out how important this fragment is, since it “connects a variety of types of image which are usually preserved only in fragments.”</p><p>This well-moulded head, almost life-size and with sharply defined features, was one of a number (see also Fig. 134) found in a shrine slightly apart from the rest and raised on a high-walled terrace, whose brickwork was strengthened with layers of reeds. The interior of the shrine was completely filled with hard-burned debris, and Stein only had time to effect a partial clearance around the entrance. No trace was found of the bodies belonging to this or to other similar heads, all close in style to those found in nearby ruins (x-xii). Stein’s explanation was that the bodies were insufficiently fired in the conflagration that destroyed the temple, but another observation should perhaps be made here. Although reports from other sites (cf. Toumchouq, 1964, Vol. Ⅱ, p. 142) confirm that the material used was generally clay mixed with some fibre, it seems probable that the heads, moulded and fashioned separately, could have been hardened in the open, before being fitted to the bodies which, being necessarily modelled in situ, remained softer and more vulnerable. This might account for the preservation of so many finely detailed heads. As noted in the description of the tile seen in Pl. 112, Stein himself ventured the possibility of an actual firing of some pieces, besides the hardening and loss of colour during the destruction of the shrines.</p><p>Another sizeable fragment, Kha. i. E. 0058. c, unfortunately not reproduced here or in Serindia, has four of the small Buddhas with colours well preserved: white and red alternate in the mandorlas and ground, with occasional nimbi or mandorlas of purplish pink, while the Buddha’s robe may be red, black brown or white. Each is seated on a flat-topped padmasana with down-turned petals. The main facial features are outlined in red, but the pupils, upper eyelids and eyebrows are in ink. The two small fragments shown in Fig. 42 are of this type. (Figure 49, though a wooden plaque and not a wall painting, shows the correct angle at which the head was inclined; a single larger head, Kha. i. 0054,is reproduced in Serindia, Pl. XI.) The few drapery lines are in ink and occasionally accented in white, but on the whole the painters seem to have preferred the use of areas of colour without outline, so that the figures have a simple solidity. No lines are ruled between the Buddhas, the frame for each being established by the simple counterchange of colours in the ground.</p><p>Among the other fragments shown in the monochrome figures, Fig. 44 displays brilliant colours: the bodhisattva, presumably Avalokitesvara since he holds a flask, wears azure trousers; his body, outlined in red, is pink against a bright green mandorla with broad brown and red borders. The small figure nearby appears to be a donor. Plate 53-4 shows some of the same blue, less brilliant in reproduction than in the original, combined with delicate outlines and subtle green and pink shades, in a fragment of the Cosmic Vairocana with the sun disc on his shoulder and a vajra on the forearm (cf. Pl. 72 and Figs. 50, 95). Such pieces afford a mere glimpse of the wealth and quality of Khotanese painting, and it is interesting that one fragment (Fig. 43) shows a hand grasping a writing brush: the handle is of wood, with a close binding and slightly swelling bundle of hairs at the end.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>6世紀</p><p>喀達里克出土</p><p>53－1：高9.4釐米 寬11.0釐米</p><p>53－1：斯坦因繪畫271（Kha.i.E.0048）</p><p>53－2：高16.8釐米 寬16.0釐米</p><p>53－2：斯坦因繪畫268（Kha.i.C.0095）</p><p>53－3：高11.5釐米 寬10.0釐米</p><p>53－3：斯坦因繪畫275（Kha.i.E.0065）</p><p>53－4：高15.0釐米 寬10.0釐米</p><p>53－4：斯坦因繪畫261（Kha.0026）</p><p>參照Figs.42－48</p><p>智慧神像有幾分粗劣，其他諸像描繪的相當精細。特別是佛頭可與該寺址中央位置發現的大斷片（參照《西域》圖版XI， Kha.l.C.0097）相比較。斯坦因將大斷片收錄在《西域》的圖版內，當時看來破損嚴重，故本書未收錄。看《西域》圖版，就會發現當初極壯觀的構圖，以及有規則地配置小佛坐像、背景顔色變換等技法。中尊佛兩手結說法印，結跏趺坐在蓮華座上，蓮花座由兩層豐滿蓮瓣對稱排列而成，背後是模式化曼陀羅火焰紋的背光。左右有長身的菩薩，腰略傾向佛立著，其腿筆直僵硬。此菩薩的姿態，與本書第1卷圖46-48的諸菩薩像，以及科茲洛夫發現于黑水城現存於艾爾米塔什美術館，時代稍晚的繪畫（參照《喜瑪拉亞的神與魔》，圖22、23，頁77）中所見的相似。</p><p>這些主尊群的周圍，配有略向前傾的小佛坐像，這看來恰似佛三尊突出在有規則地分配小佛像的背景中。此小佛群，規模雖小，但讓人想起敦煌隋唐窟中所見千佛的結構。Joanna Williams也指出，此斷片的重要性，就在於各個零七八碎很難拼合的斷片上，能看出像與像間的相互關係（參照《和田佛教美術的圖像》，1973，110頁）。</p><p>此外，《西域》中沒有收錄，遺憾的是本書選材時也遺漏了的，還有色彩保存較好的四身小佛的略大些的斷片Kha.i.E.0058.c。那斷片上，身光和底色交替搭配著白和紅色，紅色時而在頭光上，時而又用在身光上。而佛的衣服爲紅、黑、茶、白等色，都坐在平坦的覆瓣蓮花座上。臉部的主要部分用朱線描繪，瞼和眉毛使用了黑色。Fig. 42展示的兩塊斷片與此是同類作品（收錄於《西域》圖版XI的繪有佛頭的斷片Kha.i.0054，也是與此同類的作品。另外，本書Fig. 49，雖然是板繪而不是壁畫，但前側向的臉部表現與此相同）。衣紋線使用黑色，偶爾用白色來突出，大概是畫家比較喜歡省略輪廓線而以色面來表現，佛像具有一點立體感。各小佛坐像間沒有分界線，只是調換每個像框的底色來體現。</p><p>黑白圖版展示的壁畫斷片中，Fig. 44可見有美麗的色彩：從手持淨瓶判斷是觀音菩薩，身著淡青色衣裙，有紅色輪廓的肉身上染了淡紅色，與有茶和紅色寬邊的亮綠色背光形成鮮明的對比。近處的小像可能是供養人。圖53－4中，可見精細的輪廓線和淡紅的暈染，有美麗的淡綠和青的色彩。一個斷片為肩有日輪、前臂有金剛的毗盧遮那佛(參見圖72 及 Figs. 50, 95)，從這些壁畫的斷片，可窺到和田壁畫的興盛及其品質的一端，而描繪著手握毛筆的一個斷片(Fig. 43)也是饒有意義的。那筆的桿是木製的，略有些蓬鬆的毛束被牢固地捆在一起。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 53-3"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.275</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Fragments of wall painting</title><title lang="chi-Hant">佛頭雕塑</title><note lang="eng"><p>Ca. 6th century A.

The fourth piece is also from Khadalik, but its exact position on the site is not known. The site was abandoned towards the end of the eighth century, as established by Stein from finds of coins at the site (see Serindia, Vol. I, p. 159).</p><p>Although the figure of Ganesa is somewhat coarsely drawn, the other figures are finely delineated.

Although this larger fragment, which is still in the British Museum, has suffered considerably since its reproduction by Stein, the plate in Serindia shows both the splendour of the original composition and the way in which it was related to small seated figures of the Buddha, alternating in background colour. The Buddha is seated with hands in the teaching mudra; his lotus throne has two rows of fleshy petals, symmetrically disposed. Behind him is a mandorla of stylized flames. On either side stand tall Bodhisattvas, swaying at the waist slightly towards the Buddha, the legs very stiff and straight. Their form is close to that of the individual Bodhisattvas of Vol. 1, Pls. 46-48, and the stance recurs much later in most of the paintings found by Kozlov at Kharakhoto and now in the Hermitage Museum, Leningrad (cf.

At one house, some three kilometers north of the ruined stupa at Niya, Stein excavated a rubbish deposit and found over two hundred and fifty documents on wood and leather. A number of these were wooden slips bearing a single column of Chinese characters, after the fashion of Han dynasty bamboo slip records. A date of A.D. 269 was subsequently found on one of these by Chavannes. The third-century date of the whole site was confirmed by his important discovery.</p><p>This pair of chair legs and a third leg from another chair were found in the corridor of a substantial dwelling house south of the ruined stupa. This house, N. Ⅳ (see Ancient Khotan, Pl. XXXI), was close to N. Ⅲ from which came the table in Pl. 60. Other finds from the same corridor include the head of a musical instrument (Fig. 72) and pieces of woolen carpet. In one of the adjoining rooms (N.x) there were numerous tablets in Kharosthi script, writing instruments and unused tablets.</p><p>Each of the legs has a human face-the left one female, the right male-on a bird-like body surmounting a horse’s hoof. Above the hoof, the leg becomes a half-open lotus on which the figure perches. The models for such hybrid forms were derived from India and the classical West. The side pieces of the seat frame were tenoned and mortised into the back of the heads, as seen in another chair leg from Loulan, where part of the seat frame survives (see Serindia, Pl. XXXIV). The hooked part at the top is not just part of the headdress but also served to secure a cushion.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>3～4世紀</p><p>尼雅出土</p><p>彩色木雕</p><p>高34.6釐米，34.5釐米</p><p>1907 11—11 92（N.xii.3）</p><p>尼雅遺迹的大多數住居遺址，曾有過各種果樹的大果樹園。斯坦因發掘尼雅廢塔北邊房屋的垃圾堆，獲得了達250餘件木簡和皮革文書。那木簡大部分延續著漢代的形式，書寫一行漢字。其中包括沙畹後來發現有泰始五年（269年）紀年的作品，其重要的發現，確定了此遺迹是屬3世紀的。</p><p>本圖展示的兩個椅子腿，和另一件一起，在位於廢塔南邊富裕的居址的走廊發現的。被稱之爲N（尼雅）IV的此居址（參照《古代和田》圖版XXXI），緊挨著圖60的木雕家具腿部所出土的N.III址。從同一走廊發現的遺物中，還有樂器的頭部（參照Fig. 72）和毛織的墊毯斷片類。從鄰近的N.x.室中，發現多件佉盧文木簡和摻雜在其中未使用過的木簡。</p><p>本圖中的椅子腿的頂部表現的是，左方是女、右邊是男性的臉。同時，軀體像鳥的形態，下部是帶蹄子的馬腿形，兩者交界處是半開的蓮華形。以上的各種內容，摻雜了起源於印度和西方的內容。</p><p>頭部背後有榫孔，知道它插入橫木的組合方式。那種方式，在樓蘭出土的仍殘留著部分框架的椅子腿（參照《西域》圖版XXXIV）上，看得更清楚。頂部的鈎把手部分，不僅僅表示是冠，還起著固定椅子面的作用。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 60"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1907, 1111.85</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Table or altar frame</title><title lang="chi-Hant">木雕家具腿部（小桌或祭壇）</title><note lang="eng"><p>1st-4th century A.D.</p><p>From Niya</p><p>Carved poplar wood</p><p>H. 60.0 cm.

Through this piece, preserved largely intact, we can form some idea of the way in which the panelling of the rooms was arranged. On the legs as well as the sides and ends, the decoration is divided into panels, often with beaded borders that correspond closely in motif to the larger panels from the ruined Buddhist shrine, Loulan B. II.</p><p>The commonest motif here is the four-petalled flower, readily adapted to fill rectangular or square spaces, and seen here on the legs as well as flanking the central motif on the front panel, while at the ends (Fig. 70-a) the flower motif is split so as to fill one large and two much smaller triangles. On a large table or desk from Loulan (Fig.31), the motif is used in much smaller squares to cover the surfaces of both legs and side panels. The same motif was used to decorate part of the wall panelling in the Buddhist shrine L. B.II (Fig. 28).</p><p>The front panel (Fig. 70-b) is of the most interest, since here the flowers flank a central motif, which is manifestly a Buddhist stupa garlanded and bedecked with streamers (although Stein thought it was a “pomegranate [?]”). Together with the eight-petalled lotuses that appear on the front legs, this leaves no doubt as to the Buddhist character of the frame, which was described by Stein as a chair but which seems altogether more likely to have been a small table, or even an altar.

Lying to the north of Khotan, high sand dunes helped to preserve it while subsoil water had destroyed the timbers that served to support its sculptures. The plan (see Ancient Khotan, Pl.XL) shows a vihāra court 161 feet (49.1 m)long by 141 feet (43.0m)wide, within which rose a stupa in three storeys, the lowest some 78 feet (23.8m)square. The stupa was approached by a staircase in the centre of each side; its summit, as measured by Stein, was some 23 1/2 feet (7.1m) above the floor of the court. The enclosing wall of this vihāra court was adorned, both inside and outside, with rows of colossal statues in clay stucco, supported on a wooden framework, which had completely disappeared.</p><p>Because of the friable nature of the material, it was not possible for Stein to recover any of the larger figures intact: “All that could be done in the case of these large sculptures was to bury them again safely in the sand after they had been photographed and described” (Ancient Khotan, Vol.Ⅰ, p.502). The stupa and some of the very numerous statues lining the inner and outer walls of the stupa court are shown in Ancient Khotan (Figs.59-69), and other photographs from Emil Trinkler’s investigation of the site in 1927-28 are published by Gerd Gropp (1974, Figs.93-111 and Pls.XIII-XVIII). All of these show the magnificent scale of the whole sculptural arrangement, with larger than life-size standing figures of the Buddha alternating with smaller Buddha and Bodhisattva figures, some of them seated. The relatively small areas of wall in between the large relief figures were plastered and bore wall paintings of smaller figures, some of these probably being later additions (see Ancient Khotan, Vol.Ⅰ, p.492).</p><p>The head shown here is from R. vi, one of the smaller Buddha figures on the inner south-west wall, standing between colossal Buddhas: the figure was broken by the fall of one of these(R. v, shown in Ancient Khotan, Fig.61) after it had been exposed for a day, but the head had been removed first and so survived. According to Stein, it was“in respect of pose, size and drapery a replica of the Buddha image R. ii. ”This figure, also visible in Fig.61 and, with its head in place, in Fig.69 of Ancient Khotan, was described by Stein in some detail (ibid., Vol. Ⅰ, pp.490-91). The form of the body is clearly visible, very narrow waisted and with swelling hips, beneath the drapery. As in the Gupta style, the drapery runs in raised lines over the smooth forms underneath, but here the lines are close-set and form stylised waves running down the figure from the neck-line. Behind the head, the nimbus was arranged in similar fashion to those reproduced by Gropp (1974, Figs.101, 103, 110) with a border of large overlapping spiral cloud scrolls, and a pointed flame extension at the top. Small seated appliqué figures of the Buddha, one at the top and two more on each side of the head, were set within the nimbus. The small appliqué seated Buddha in Pl.65 was intended for such a purpose, and is very similar, though it came from a different statue, R.lxxxiv.</p><p>Although small in size compared with the largest figures, this head displays their principal characteristics. The whole face below the hairline is modelled in smooth curves, with very slight transitions between planes: in profile the eyebrows mark such a shift with little more than an incised line, and the small chin protrudes only slightly from the surrounding area. The eyes are sharply defined and are additionally modelled by a thick white application of stucco along the edges of the upper and lower lids. Little evidence remains of the original whitewash which probably covered the figure. Stein was able to describe a pink tīkā in the centre of the forehead, now difficult to distinguish. At the back of the head, a rectangular hollow almost the full width of the head marks the size of the supporting member of the timber framework behind the figure.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>4～5世紀</p><p>熱瓦克出土</p><p>泥塑彩繪</p><p>高23.5cm</p><p>熱瓦克塔是斯坦因第一次考古探險時發現的非常重要的遺跡之一。遺跡位於和闐北部，由於地下水的緣故支撐雕像群的木材已經腐蝕，然而厚厚的沙丘使它保存至今。據平面圖（參照《古代和闐》圖XL），寺址是49.1×43.0m的長方形，中央建有三層方塔，塔基邊長約23.8m。塔的各面中央設有臺階，據斯坦因測量，離地面約7.1m高。寺址四周圍牆的內外兩側都塑有聖像，莊嚴肅穆。最初支撐著的木架現在完全散落。</p><p>這些聖像質地脆弱易壞，斯坦因不可能完整地帶走較大的塑像。他說“我們拍照攝影和調查記錄工作結束後，只能把這些大塑像安全地埋回沙漠了”（《古代和闐》，卷1，502頁）。有關該塔和寺址圍牆內外側的塑像，除了《古代和闐》（圖59～69）外，Gerd Gropp出版的1927～1928年Emil Trinkler在此遺跡進行調查時所拍照片（《中國新疆•和闐考古發現》，1974，圖93～111及圖XIII-XVIII）中也有收錄。由此可瞭解造像規模之大，其中有比人高的立佛像，也有小一點的佛及菩薩塑像，有些是坐著的。在大佛像之間極狹窄的壁面上，塗上灰泥，繪有小的圖像，但其中有不少是後來加上的（見《古代和闐》，卷1，492頁）。</p><p>本圖所示的佛像頭部，是西南壁內側巨像間站立的一小佛像的頭部（R.vi）。此像因一身巨佛像的癱倒而毀壞（R.v，見《古代和闐》，圖61），由於風吹日曬，致使頭部與軀幹分離而殘存下來。依據斯坦因的說法，此像從“姿態、尺寸和衣紋等方面看，是R.vii佛像的複製品”。《古代和闐》的插圖61和69可以看到該像的全貌，斯坦因也作了詳細的記述（參照同書的490～491頁）。通過衣紋可清楚看到其體型為細腰肥臀Gupta風格的佛像。衣紋的線條隆起，柔順地覆蓋著身體，各個線條的間隔狹窄，形成波浪狀，從領口順著身體往下垂。頭部後面與Gropp（《中國新疆•和闐考古學發現》，1974，圖101，103，110）的形式一樣，旋渦狀的雲紋重合在大型帶狀紋的寶珠形項光上。在頭頂上和頭的兩側各貼一身小化佛。圖65的小佛就和這個小化佛一樣，儘管來自不同的塑像R.lxxxiv。</p><p>雖然尺寸與大的造像相比要少得多，但此像頭部也展示了其主要特徵。臉部前額的髮際刻板地往下拉，五官只有極小的起伏。即使從側面看，也只有一些微小的變化，眉毛只是稍有塌陷的刻線，下巴比其他部位稍微突起。眼睛很大，很清楚，上下眼瞼合在一起，貼著厚厚的白色睫毛。當初大概所有佛像都用白灰塗飾過，現在幾乎沒有痕跡了。在斯坦因記錄中，額中央還有粉色的白毫，但現在卻無法辨清。從頭像背後幾乎與頭尺寸相等的長方形凹槽可以想像原先支撐雕像木架之大。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 64"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1907, 1111.178</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Seated Buddha</title><title lang="chi-Hant">彩塑佛坐像</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 8th- 9th century A.D.</p><p>From Rawak</p><p>Red clay with red wash</p><p>H. 17.0 cm, W. 12.8 cm</p><p>British Museum,1907 11-11 178 (R. xxv. 3)</p><p>This seated figure, entirely flat at the back, was made in a mould as an appliqué piece.

X. 4)</p><p>This is one of the most arresting of the painted wooden plaques found by Stein at Dandan-oilik, all of which owe their fine state of preservation to the fact that they were placed above floor level. D.X at this site was a small cella with wall paintings of rows of small Buddha figures and a single stucco image, nothing of which remained, however, save the octagonal base, waisted in hourglass fashion, with a broad ledge at the bottom for offerings. The plaque was standing on end against one of the facets of the base.</p><p>The figures are depicted, as in the fragments of wall painting from Khadalik, with the main features outlined in red, and the upper eyelids and eyebrows in black. Stein recognized the subject as the legend of the introduction of sericulture to Khotan. The central figure is the Chinese princess who, according to Xuanzang (Da Tang xiyu ji, Chapter 12), warned by the envoys that there was no means of raising silkworms or mulberry leaves in Khotan, hid mulberry seeds and the eggs of the silk moth in her headdress (here indicated by the attendant on the left) and smuggled them to Khotan to raise silkworms from them, thereby circumventing the Chinese embargo on their export, which had previously frustrated the king of Khotan’s efforts to obtain the means of making silk. At the border post, the official did not dare to examine her headdress. The resulting cocoons are seen in a basket in front of the princess.</p><p>At the far right another figure stands by a loom with stretched warp, holding a beating comb in her hand, like those illustrated in Figs. 34-35. Behind her is an object that may be a reel for thread, and between her and the princess sits a presiding four-armed deity. All these identifications were made by Stein, who also noted the petal-shaped spots of dark pink set around the figures, and compared them to the auspicious sandal-ointment marks used by Hindus. In addition the four-armed god has been identified by N. V.D’ yakonova as a patron of weaving, presiding over the Silk Legend, as on this panel, and occasionally represented separately, as in Pl. 70-2 and another panel in the Hermitage Museum, Leningrad (Joanna Williams, 1973, Fig. 63). Still another panel on exhibition in the Hermitage Museum (ibid., Fig. 64) presents the same figures in a vertical composition, with the four-armed god at the top of the panel and below him the princess holding the bowl of cocoons, with a kneeling attendant holding a shuttle (?). Below that, the princess is shown once more, this time with an attendant pointing at her headdress, just as in the Stein panel reproduced here.</p><p>Yet another panel brought by Stein from Dandan-oilik, and now in New Delhi (ibid., Fig. 58, and Ancient Khotan, Pl. LXVII), displays a slightly different version of the same subject, which can be seen as an important local legend, of which the panel shown here was the first and is still the finest example.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>6世紀</p><p>丹丹烏里克</p><p>木板畫</p><p>高12.0釐米，寬46.0釐米</p><p>英國博物館，1907 11－11 73（D.X.4）</p><p>斯坦因在丹丹烏里克發現的木板畫中，此繪畫是最爲引人注目的作品，由於是放在地板上，保存狀態極好。發現它的丹丹烏里克D.X寺址，是一個有數層千佛壁畫以及一身塑像的小屋。現在塑像已沒有了，只剩下中間細的漏斗狀八角形台座，下面曾有放供物的寬架子，此木板畫正好靠放在台座的一面。</p><p>臉部與喀達里克壁畫的斷片一樣，主要輪廓線用紅色描繪，上瞼和眉毛上加了墨色。斯坦因認爲，此主題與養蠶技術傳到于闐的傳說故事有關。主要人物是中國公主，據玄奘的《大唐西域記》（12章）記載，于闐過去沒有桑葉，也沒有蠶，于闐王命令使者去求得桑葉和蠶，但中國禁止帶出國外。於是，她便將桑種和繭藏在頭飾中（左邊的侍女正在指著），嫁到于闐。國境的關卡不可能查到頭飾，計劃順利成功。從此于闐開始養蠶，公主前面的籃子裏盛滿了繭。</p><p>站在撐滿經線的織機旁右端的像，右手拿著與Figs. 34-35展示的相同的筬。她後邊放著紡車樣的器械，她和公主中間坐著四臂神像。斯坦因對以上進行過比定，也進一步對散落于諸像周邊的暗紅色花瓣形裝飾，和印度教的塗白檀香的吉祥標誌做了比較。另外，N. V.D’ yakonova將四臂神像與掌管養蠶的編織守護神作了比定，圖70－2和艾爾米塔什美術館收藏的另外的一塊木板畫（參照Joanna Williams《和田佛教美術圖像》，Fig. 63），是作爲獨立像描繪的。而陳列于艾爾米塔什美術館的有另外一塊木板畫，內容是縱向排列的（同上，參照Fig. 64），最上部繪著四臂像，其下是手持盛繭容器的公主和手捧梭樣器械跪著的侍女，最下段描繪的公主和指向其頭飾的侍女的樣子，與本圖木板畫中的一樣。</p><p>同樣，斯坦因從丹丹烏里克所獲現藏新德里國立博物館一塊木板畫（同上，參照Fig. 58及《古代和田》圖版LXVII）也繪有相同主題，但其表現形式略有变化，可以視爲當地的一個重要傳説。此木板畫較本圖所示的年代早，而且更爲精美。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 67"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1907, 1111.72</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="san">Votive plaque with Indra, Maya-Sri and Brahma (?)</title><title lang="chi-Hant">三神像</title><note lang="eng"><p>Ca.6th century A.D.</p><p>From Dandan-oilik</p><p>Painted wood</p><p>H. 10.6 cm, W. 25.8 cm</p><p>British Museum,1907 11-11 72 (D.

The identification of these figures has been put forward by Joanna Williams in the article already quoted in the notes to the preceding plate. She identifies the figure on the left as Indra, crowned and holding a vajra; at the other end could be Brahma, with three (out of four) heads and a third eye in each, holding a bow and arrows and a drinking bowl. The figure in the centre is suggested with less certainty by Williams as a goddess of abundance, in which case this whole group, with the Hindu gods Indra and Brahma might refer to an event such as the Buddha’s birth. The goddess holds aloft the sun and moon, as do some of the other deities in this series of votive panels from Khotan (see Pl. 70-1), and another unidentified attribute.</p><p>On the reverse (Fig. 97), two Buddhas are seated in the centre, looking towards one another, one in a red robe, the other in white, with fine drapery lines in ink.

They are similar to the rows of small Buddhas from wall painting fragments in the Khotan area.</p><p>On the front the two main figures are larger: on the left the torso of a male figure, holding a fan and looking towards an animal-headed deity, which is crowned and splendidly garbed in red and blue. The deity was identified by Stein as the Rat King: according to a legend related by Xuanzang in Da Tang xiyu ji, the king of Khotan was able to defeat an attack by the Xiongnu thanks to golden rats which gnawed the bowstrings and other gear of the latter, and which were consequently worshipped at a shrine west of Khotan. Kumagai Nobuo (1962, p. 102) notes that this plaque links folk legends with Buddhism in a special way not found among the terracottas from Khotan. Joanna Williams (1973, p. 152) considers that it is equally possible that the figure may represent a wolf head as in a votive plaque from Tarishlak (Serindia, Pl. XII) and so one of the grahas, or beings with supernatural influence over the health of children. Another votive plaque (Fig. 96), showing two women each holding a baby, must have been intended to secure protection for them, while one of the six female spirits shown in Vol. 2, Pl. 75 is a wolf-headed figure, identified in the Khotanese inscription as Mukhamanda: this deity, according to the Chinese inscription also on the painting, had to be propitiated in order to protect the child. Thus the question of identification of the middle figure must remain open. The third smaller figure has suffered some abrasion and does not help to resolve the matter.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>6世紀</p><p>丹丹烏里克出土</p><p>木板畫</p><p>高10.6釐米,寬44.8釐米</p><p>英國博物館，1907 11－11 68(D.

A similar horse and rider, originally one of a series of riders on horses and camels, appears in the wall painting of the Sudhana jataka which Stein photographed in Shrine II at Dandan-oilik but was unable to remove, and which has always been counted as one of the masterpieces of Khotanese painting (see Andrews, 1948, Pl. XXXII).</p><p>It has been suggested by Joanna Williams that the meaning of this theme may be provided by its association with Vaisravana on a painted wooden panel acquired from Khotan by Sir Clarmont Skrine and now in the British Museum (1925 6-19 25): in it the rider advances towards a standing figure of the Guardian King, and is accompanied by two black birds. Vaisravana had a special position as guardian of Khotan (cf. Vol. 2,Pl. 50), and the riders with birds may represent Khotan’s Turkish neighbours, following a legend in which one of Vaisravana’s yaksa attendants shot down Pekar, the tutelary hero of the Uighur Turks, when he had assumed the form of a bird of prey (Williams, 1973, pp. 151-52). In this case the figures in this panel would represent tributaries to Khotan.</p><p>The reverse of this plaque is unpainted and has the remains of several wooden pegs by which it could be hung of fastened to the wall of the shrine.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>6世紀</p><p>丹丹烏里克出土</p><p>木板畫</p><p>高38.5釐米,寬18.0釐米</p><p>英國博物館，1907 11－11 70（D.VII.5）</p><p>描绘貴族騎士手持碗或酒杯，有鳥飛下的題材，常見於和田附近地區。如果單講騎士乘用有斑點的馬或駱駝，則使想起墨畫淡彩的《馬·駱駝進貢圖》（參照第二卷圖56）及阿斯塔那古墓出土的大型馬俑（參照圖91）等作品。相似的馬和騎士還可在描绘“龍鼓池傳說”的和田壁畫中见到，斯坦因曾在丹丹烏里克第II寺址中，對其壁畫進行过拍攝，但没有采用。此壁畫常被作爲和田壁畫的代表作之一而被提起（參照Andrews《中亞壁畫》,1948,圖版XXXII）。</p><p>有關這一主題的含義，據Joanna Williams所述，與Clarmont Skrine收集于和田，現藏于大英博物館的木板畫（1925 6－19 35）上所見的毘沙門天像有關。那幅木板畫中，繪有騎馬人物行向天王立像，還配有兩隻黑色的鳥。毘沙門天作爲于闐的保護神佔有特殊地位（參照第2卷圖50的解說），伴隨鳥的騎馬人物表現的是于闐鄰國的突厥人。據傳說，毘沙門天的侍者，討伐裝扮成餌食鳥的突厥回鶻族的守護神白哈爾（Pekar）（參照上述Williams論文，131～152頁）。如果是這樣，此木板畫則描繪的是于闐屬國的人物。</p><p>其背面沒有繪畫，殘存數枚木釘，或為固定在寺院牆上之用。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 70"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1907, 1111.71</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="san">Votive plaque with Mahesvara (obverse) and the God of Silk (reverse)</title><title lang="chi-Hant">濕婆神像、絹的守護神像</title><note lang="eng"><p>Ca. 6th century A.D.</p><p>From Dandan-oilik</p><p>Painted wood</p><p>H. 33.0 cm, W. 20.2 cm</p><p>British Museum,1907 11-11 71 (D.

The triple-headed deity, with one fierce grotesque head and one feminine or benign one, is ithyphallic and holds the sun and moon, a vajra and another object. He has been identified by Joanna Williams (1973, pp. 142-45) as Mahesvara, the name by which Siva appears in Khotanese texts. As such he is seated on the vehicle of Siva, the bull Nandin, here shown twice.</p><p>Siva’s presence at Khotan shows the influence of tantric Buddhism and Saivism from India: forms of Siva, which reached both Yungang (Cave 8, Northern Wei, late fifth century A.D.) and Dunhuang (Cave 285, Western Wei, early sixth century A.D.) are referred to by Williams. In the case of Cave 285 (Chugoku Sekkutsu, Tonko Makkokutsu, Vol. 2, Pl. 119), he is shown with three heads and six arms, holding aloft the sun and moon discs and seated on a blue bull. The early date at which these Siva images made their appearance in China might lead one to question whether this image, and indeed the other wooden painted plaques from the Khotan area, may not also be dated nearer the sixth century than the eighth that is generally accepted (because of numerous finds of eighth-century Chinese coins) as the terminus ante quem for both the wall paintings and the votive plaques.</p><p>The image on the reverse side (Pl. 70-2) reveals in its style the influence of Iran: the heavily bearded deity is garbed in princely costume, with a golden cap or crown, green flowered tunic, flowered undergarment and trousers, and long black boots; a dagger lies in his lap. The objects that he carries are not easily identifiable but are clearly the same as those carried by the four-armed figure presiding over the Legend of the Silk Princess (Pl. 66-2). It has been suggested that they represent a goblet, and a weaver’s comb and shuttle. Other single figures from the Khotan area that have been identified as the God of Silk or the Patron of Weaving are listed by Williams (1973, pp. 147-50).</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>6世紀</p><p>丹丹烏里克出土</p><p>木板畫</p><p>高33.0釐米,寬20.2釐米</p><p>英國博物館，1907 11－11 71（D.VII.6）</p><p>此畫是從丹丹烏里克攜來的木版畫中最精美的一幅，保存狀態極好。圖70－1比原大稍微小一點，圖70－2是此畫的背面，局部特寫。</p><p>圖70－1所展示的畫面，是伴有威嚴怪異的臉和溫柔表情的女性臉的三面六臂，手持日月和金剛杵等的坐像。Joanna Williams (1973, 142-45頁)將此像比定爲于闐文經典中以大自在天之名出現的濕婆神。這樣，牛則成爲濕婆神的坐騎南迪，但在這裏牛被繪成兩頭。</p><p>和田中的濕婆神顯示了印度密教和濕婆信仰的影響波及到了此地區。Williams還說，在雲崗（第8窟，北魏，5世紀末）和敦煌（第285窟，西魏，6世紀初）也見到濕婆像。敦煌285窟的（參照《中國石窟 敦煌莫高窟》第2卷，圖119），其像有三面六臂，高舉日輪、月輪，坐於青色的牡牛上。舉出如此早期的例子，來比較此木板畫，認爲木板畫是6世紀的不是更合適嗎？和田地區出土的木板畫其年代比一直認爲是8世紀（基於這裏大量出土過8世紀的中國貨幣），所以得出壁畫和木版畫也是8世紀的結論。</p><p>背面（圖70－2）上畫的像顯然受波斯的影響，長著濃髯的此神像，頭頂金色寶冠，披著束腰綠色花紋外衣，穿著花內衣和褲子，腳穿黑長靴，腰挎匕首，是典型的貴族裝束。其手所持之物難很難確認，但確實與《養蠶西漸傳說》中出現的四臂像（參照圖66－2）的手持物相同，有杯、機織的筬和梭。在Williams的論文（參照《和田佛教美術的圖像》，1973年，頁147-150）中，列舉了在和田地區發現的其他單身像中還有認爲是絹神或編織的保護神。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 71"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1907, 1111.67</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Votive plaque with a standing Buddha</title><title lang="chi-Hant">佛立像</title><note lang="eng"><p>Ca. 6th century A.D.</p><p>From Dandan-oilik</p><p>Painted wood</p><p>H. 26.4 cm, W. 13.0 cm</p><p>British Museum,1907 11-11 67 (D.

On the side seen here, he is clad in a red robe, within an oval vesica which has lost all pigment. The details of the face are outlined in red on a white ground, while the folds of the robe are in ink. On the other side (Fig. 95). The Buddha is unclad save for a loin cloth; the hands are in the same mudra. Much of the white pigment has been lost, but a few details such as the vajra on the forearm and the double rings on the upper legs show that this is Vairocana, the Buddha in his cosmic aspect, with various forms (in which he may exist) depicted on, meaning within, his body.</p><p>Eiichi Matsumoto, in a series of articles in 1936 (Kokka, nos. 548, 549, 551), was the first to point out the importance of Khotan as a centre of the Avatamsaka Sutra and in its eastward propagation from the fifth century or even earlier until the close of the eighth century. Between A.D. 418 and 421 the first Chinese translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra was made by Buddhabhadra from a Sanskrit version of the sutra obtained from Khotan. More recently, the problems of the iconography of Khotanese Buddhism have been explored by Joanna Williams (1973, pp. 117-24), who was able to find still more examples of the Cosmic Vairocana among the extant remnants of the art of Khotan. Those shown in this volume include a fragment of a wall painting from Khadalik (Pl. 53-4) and a plaque from Farhad-beg-yailaki (Pl. 72), as well as the present example. Still other wall paintings and plaques have been published by Gerd Gropp (1974; see especially pp. 132-33).</p><p>The style revealed in these two figures shows little evidence of Chinese influence. The whole of each figure conforms closely to the shallow curves of the surrounding vesica; the legs are almost straight, the arms held close to the sides, the head a large oval with features almost geometrically disposed. In the robed figure of Pl. 71 the drapery lines still echo fairly closely the classical Gandharan arrangement, the left hand holding a loop of robe. At Dunhuang we find more movement even in the figures of the earliest caves, while the first example of the Cosmic Vairocana, from Cave 428 of the Northern Zhou (A.D. 550-57) already shows a more developed type of Vairocana, no longer naked but clad in an ample robe on which are depicted scenes of Mt. Sumeru (Chugoku Sekkutsu, Tonko Makkokutsu, Vol. 1, Pl. 162). Thus the sixth century would appear to be the latest possible date for the plaque.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>6世紀</p><p>丹丹烏里克出土</p><p>木板畫</p><p>高26.4釐米,寬13.0釐米</p><p>英國博物館，1907 11－11 67（D.IV.4）</p><p>參照Fig.95</p><p>此木板畫的兩面都繪著右手結施無畏印的佛立像。本圖所揭示的面上，佛穿赤褐色衣，有橢圓形頭光，但頭光的顔色幾乎全部殘失。佛的臉部則是在白底上施以紅色的輪廓線，衣褶則用墨綫。背面（Fig. 95）的佛是以布纏腰的裸身，手印與前相同，白色顔料大多已脫落，從前膊的金剛杵及膝蓋上方雙層的輪等特徵可看出是毘廬遮那佛，身上畫著各種形象（其中也包括佛）。</p><p>松本榮一博士于1936年發表的一系列論文（《國華》，第548、549、551號）中首次指出了于闐作爲《華嚴經》中心的重要性，以及《華嚴經》的東漸是從5世紀或稍早些到8世紀末。而418年至421年間佛馱跋陀羅首次進行的《華嚴經》漢譯，也是譯自從于闐獲得的梵文經典。對於和田的佛教圖像，近年Joanna Williams進行了調查（參照《和田佛教美術的圖像》，1973年，頁117-124），從大量和田繪畫中發現了許多毘廬遮那佛像。本書所舉出的毘廬遮那佛像的作品，除本圖外，還可見於喀達里克的壁畫斷片（圖53－4）以及法哈特伯克亞依拉克（末城）的木板畫（圖72），而在Gerd Gropp的著作（1974年，特別是頁132-133）中還其他壁畫和木板畫的例子。</p><p>這兩個圖像在風格上幾乎感覺不到中國影響的因素。身體恰好容在用流暢的線條繪的身光裏，兩腿筆直，兩臂緊貼在身體兩側，橢圓形的頭部幾乎是用幾何圖案處理的。圖71左手所執衣邊的衣紋處理，可看出古典的犍陀羅雕刻殘影。在敦煌，早期石窟造像就有比此有發展的造像。在北周時期（550～557年）的第428窟展示了成熟的毘盧遮那佛造像，不裸身，著衣，衣上還畫有須彌山（參照《中國石窟 敦煌莫高窟》第1卷，圖162）。從上所述，可以考慮此木板畫最遲在6世紀就出現了。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 72"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.459</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="san">Cosmic Vairocana</title><title lang="chi-Hant">毘盧遮那佛像</title><note lang="eng"><p>Ca. 6th century A.D.</p><p>Votive plaque from Farhad-beg-yailaki</p><p>Painted wood</p><p>H. 37.8 cm, W. 18.5 cm</p><p>British Museum,MAS 459 (F.

Five more plaques were found along the wall. Vairocana, the supreme Buddha, is recognized by the other images appearing on his body: two seated Buddhas appear on his torso, symbols of the sun and moon on his right and left shoulders, pairs of long rectangles on each upper arm, and a bird on each forearm, besides many double circles. The long rectangles are generally taken to represent the scriptures in the form of pothi. Joanna Williams (1973) has suggested that “the significance of the books on the arms of the Cosmic Vairocana possibly lies in their identification with the Avatamsaka Sutra itself, indicating the unusual importance of the literary basis for the iconography” (p. 123; see the notes to Pl. 71).</p><p>The buildings F. Ⅱ at Farhad-beg-yailaki, of which F. Ⅱ. iii formed a part, were thought by Stein to be the living quarters of a small monastery. The coins found at the site were all wushu pieces of the Eastern Han dynasty (A.D. 25-220), with no Tang coins, and for this as well as for stylistic reasons Stein concluded that the site had been abandoned at some time between A.D. 519, when the Chinese monk Song Yun described Mocheng (identified with Charchan by Stein; see Serindia, Vol. Ⅲ, p. 1255), and the end of the sixth century. This conclusion still seems to be a reasonable one: the oval shape of the head and the protruding eyes recall the three dimensional images of the Buddha from Rawak.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>6世紀</p><p>末城出土</p><p>木板畫</p><p>高37.8釐米,寬18.5釐米</p><p>英國博物館，MAS459（F.II.iii.2）</p><p>參照Fig.50</p><p>此木板畫是斯坦因從三面圍有1.8m寬的走廊5.4m×4.2m的大殿的方型台座背後發現的。在這裏，沿著牆壁還發現了五件木板畫。根據身上畫的各種形象，可確認本圖的像是至高無上的毘盧遮那佛，即軀幹上有兩身坐佛，兩肩上有象徵性的日月，上臂有豎的長方形，前臂上是鳥和小的同心圓。長方形一般是表示梵夾形式的佛典。Joanna Williams則認爲“毘盧遮那佛兩臂上所繪的經本，在圖像學上作爲文獻，可以認爲它就是《華嚴經》”（參照《和田佛教美術圖像》，1973年，123頁）。</p><p>斯坦因認爲，末城F.

II. 34)</p><p>This fragment is from the smaller of two cellas of Shrine Ⅱ at Dandan-oilik excavated by Stein on his first expedition in 1900-1901. It is especially valuable since it is one of the few fragments that show how the small moulded figures, common among the finds made at many Central Asian sites, were originally used.</p><p>Shrine Ⅱ at Dandan-oilik consisted of a large and a small cella, each with its entrance on the north. The larger shrine had contained a larger than life-size figure of the Buddha standing on a central pedestal, but of this figure only the feet survived, just covered by the sand that buried the shrine to the height of a few feet. In the small cella, measuring about three and a half metres by two and a half, the main figure was a seated one, on a massive base against the south wall. A fragment of the face showed that it was more than life-size, and two lions flanked the base on which it sat. The small figures shown in this plate, and other similar figures, were found in the top layers of the sand covering the base. All of them, Stein concluded, “belonged originally to plaques which probably in the form of aureoles had adorned the uppermost part of the south wall” (Ancient Khotan, Vol. I, p. 249).</p><p>The individual Buddhas stand in abhaya-mudra, and are placed on a dark grey background on which are also painted lotuses, although these are now hard to discern. As can be seen from the plate, the figures were first moulded and then attached to the background by a pad of clay. They are painted in red and have green aureoles, and white faces, hands and feet. The moulded border was also painted in the same colours, alternating dark grey, red, green and white. One lotus flower moulded in relief and attached to the same ground also survives.</p><p>We can thus assume that many other such small standing figures, each moulded and about 15 cm high, found at various sites, were also used in the same manner. Two such figures from the Trinkler Collection, found at Rawak and now in the metropolitan Museum, New York, still hold their colouring well and are similarly placed on a background painted dark grey.</p><p>The main image in Shrine Ⅱ was flanked on one side by a large statue of the Guardian King Vaisravana, clad in a coat of mail and trampling on a demon. Below the platform, Stein found four painted wooden plaques, evidently votive offerings by the last worshippers at the shrine. Although the paintings on them were almost entirely lost, Stein later found other such painted plaques in the other shrines at the same site, a number of which are illustrated here in Pls. 66-71</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>6～7世紀</p><p>丹丹烏里克出土</p><p>彩塑</p><p>高34.7釐米,寬28.5釐米</p><p>英國博物館，1907 11－11 62（D.II.34）</p><p>此斷片是斯坦因於1900年至1901年間第一次探險時，從丹丹烏里克第II寺址二殿中的小殿獲得的。可證明中亞諸遺迹出土的相同造型的小像原來是如何使用的，因此極其珍貴。</p><p>丹丹烏里克第II寺址由大小兩殿組成，每個入口都在北面。大殿中央的基壇上曾有超過真人大的佛立像，現只剩此像的脚部，被埋于室內堆積高數英尺的沙子中。3.5m×2.5m的小殿裏，緊接南壁的基壇上安置有佛坐像。根據頭部斷片推斷是超過真人的像，基壇上蹲著兩頭橫向的獅子。本圖的小像和其他同類像都是從埋沒基壇的沙子表層發現的。斯坦因推測，這些“本來都是裝飾南壁上端，大概是背光的裝飾板”（《古代和田》，卷1，249頁）。</p><p>結施無畏印的兩身佛立像，是安置在暗灰色的背板上，板上曾繪有蓮花，現很難分辨。從圖版上也能明白，像先是用模子製作，再填上粘土安裝到背板上，衣服是赤色，背光用綠色，臉、手和脚用白色上彩。背光的邊緣也是用模子做的，用暗灰、赤、綠、白色交叉搭配組合，板上粘的模制蓮花還殘留了一朵。</p><p>根據以上的例子，可以推測從其他諸遺迹發現的，每個都是15cm左右的用模子製作的小立像，都是使用同一方法製作的。Trinkler發現于熱瓦克，現藏于紐約大都會美術館的兩身像，色彩保存良好，也是安裝在塗成暗灰色的背板上。</p><p>第II寺的本尊，一邊是身披鎧甲、踏著邪鬼的大毘沙門天像。斯坦因從基壇下發現了有彩畫的四片木製裝飾板，可能是最後的信徒捐贈此寺的遺物。儘管那些繪畫幾乎全部消失，但斯坦因後來從同一遺迹的另一寺址携來了同樣的木版畫，已將它們展現圖66～71中。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 74"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.5</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Fragment of a model shrine</title><title lang="chi-Hant">陶制寺院模型斷片</title><note lang="eng"><p>4th-5th century A.D.</p><p>From Yotkan</p><p>Terracotta</p><p>H. 12.0 cm, W. 13.5 cm</p><p>British Museum,MAS 5 (Yo. 02)</p><p>See also Fig. 99</p><p>This fragment, purchased by Stein from the site of Yotkan, is a very finely worked and interesting piece. It is part of a flat slab, elaborately decorated as the façade of a building on the front side, and with some decoration on the back also (Fig. 99). The whole organization of the front side is very close to Gandharan art, with niches, each with a musician, forming an arcade. The arches are supported by squat Indo-Corinthian columns and a rosette appears in the spandrel between them. Above runs a continuous band with twisted strands, alternately plain and beaded; on this are stepped merlons with miniature figures of men and an elephant between them.</p><p>Stein himself (Serindia, Vol. I, p. 98) thought that this might have been part of an exceptionally large vase, and Kumagai (1962, p. 79) showed two fragments of the rim of a large vessel with similar decoration above appliqué masks and large lotus petals, from the Otani Collection (ibid., Pl. 2 and Figs. 129-30). The Stein fragment, however, cannot have come from a vase, as it is quite flat, and furthermore the reverse is also decorated. There is a similar fragment also from Yotkan in the British Museum (1902 12-20); though smaller, it shows a musician playing a flute, next to a stepped merlon. Both this and the Stein piece display rosettes and the broken edge of a perforated ledge, supported by a roll of clay, on the reverse side (Fig. 99). A third piece brought from Khotan by Trinkler and acquired by the Metropolitan Museum in 1930 provides a further clue to the original appearance of these fragments (see Gropp, 1974, Fig. 194). The Metropolitan piece is similar but is at the angle joining two sides, with an elephant’s head covering the angle on the outside. A hole, perhaps left by a small piece of wood used as an armature in the modelling, pierces the trunk and there is a strengthening pad of clay inside, but the hole is too small to have been used for pouring. The angle shows that the sides formed a hexagon. No figures survive but traces of the ledge are clear on the inner side. It therefore seems likely that all three fragments were parts of small model shrines. The rosettes on the inner walls, above the ledge, may have faced a central feature, perhaps a stupa. Other fragments showing garlanded figures within arches, which definitely come from large vases (cf. Kumagai, 1962, Pl. 2), are less well finished than the pieces shown here. The main difference they display is the distinct curve and lack of any decoration on the reverse side. Another straight-walled example like the one with Indo-Corinthian columns supporting arches with relief figures beneath was among finds brought to Sven Hedin at Yotkan (Montell, 1935, Pl. VI:5). It too has a “broken-off prop” on the back, and the suggestion has been made that “it may have pertained to a miniature stupa” (ibid., p. 178).</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>4～5世紀</p><p>約特幹出土</p><p>陶器</p><p>高12.0釐米,寬13.5釐米</p><p>英國博物館，MAS5(Yo.02)</p><p>參照Fig.99</p><p>斯坦因從約特幹遺迹購入的這個斷片，是一件極精巧的、富有趣味的作品。這是裝飾建築物正面的平板的一部分，背面（Fig. 99）也有裝飾。正面的結構酷似犍陀羅藝術，每個拱形龕都配有樂伎。拱形龕用低矮的印度克林斯多式圓柱做支撐，它們之間配有花飾。其上是帶狀的和連珠狀的擰成繩子樣的帶狀裝飾。再其上，則是城齒及其間的微型人物和大象。</p><p>斯坦因自己認爲它是一個超大的花瓶的一部分（參照《西域》，卷1， 98頁），而熊谷博士則介紹了大谷收集品中的大容器邊緣部分的兩個斷片（參照《西域文化研究》，1962年，第5卷所收的〈西域美術〉，第79頁），上面貼著人頭、蓮瓣，與此裝飾相同（上揭書，圖2，插圖129～130）。然而，本圖所展示的斯坦因的斷片，完全是平的，加之背面也有裝飾，無法認爲是花瓶。大英博物館的中亞收集品中，也有一件從約特幹獲得的同樣斷片(1902 12-20)，雖然比此片小些，上面有吹橫笛的樂伎，鄰接的便是城齒。它與此圖的斷片都有圓花飾，以及類似城垛口的飾物，背面用一卷粘土支撐（參照單色圖版第99圖）。第三件斷片是Trinkler從和田發現，於1930年收入大都會美術館，提供了進一步確認這些斷片本來面目的線索（參照Gropp，1974年，Fig. 194）。大都會美術館的斷片與上面記述的兩件相同，可合併，其角的外側是象頭。有一個孔，可能是作模型框架使用的小木片造成的，或是穿透後從裏面填塞的增加強度的東西，如果是注水用的洞，又過小。從側面的角度看，大概是六角形的。此斷片上沒有像，內側留有清楚的凸突痕迹。因此，可以認爲以上三件斷片都是寺院的小模型的一部分。內壁凸帶上的圓形花紋帶，收攏於中央，可能是朝向塔的。拱形之下有持花綵的像，明顯是大容器的斷片（《西域文化研究》第5卷，1962年，圖2），都比本圖做工差。主要的差別是，它們有明顯的弧度，裏面也沒有裝飾。像本圖斷片一樣平坦，有印度克林斯多式圓柱支撐的拱形，下邊是半裸像的作品（ “Montell”，1935， Pl.VI:5），在斯文赫定從約特幹獲得的文物中，也可以見到。那斷片的背面也有凸帶，被推測爲“與小形舍利塔相襯”（上揭書178頁）。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 75"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.2</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Figurine of a woman</title><title lang="chi-Hant">婦人像</title><note lang="eng"><p>1st-3rd century A.D.</p><p>From Yotkan</p><p>Pottery</p><p>H. 12.4 cm</p><p>MAS 2 (Yo. 1)</p><p>See also Fig. 100</p><p>The lower half of this small figure is missing.

The straight-cut fringe and the almost total absence of the forehead give a rather startled appearance to the face, and Stein described it as a “curiously rude and primitive looking work.” The eyes, opened wide, are given a double outline for which an Indian origin should perhaps be sought. The hair falls symmetrically onto the shoulders and onto the upper back with a central plait (cf. Fig. 100). At the front, below the necklace, a pair of shallowly incised lines appear to mark the hemline of a blouse or inner garment, with a central brooch or fastening (Stein took this to be a ribbon with a jewel, leaving the breasts bare). Below the raised line of the belt, the figure is broken off, and it is not easy to imagine what form it might have taken.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>1～3世紀</p><p>約特幹出土</p><p>陶器</p><p>高12.4釐米</p><p>MAS 2 （Yo.1）</p><p>參照Fig.100</p><p>此小像下半部分殘缺，口上打的洞通向體內，可能是裝油的容器。而比起這一點，此作品中最讓人感興趣的那些地方，也見於下一圖及其後的，小的人面像和動物像，特別是約特幹的猿等雕塑類中。此件是表現人像的非常珍貴的作品之一。額髮筆直，幾乎見不到額頭的臉部相當突出。對於此，斯坦因說“的確很粗野，給人以原始印象的作品”。睜得很大的眼睛，用印度雕刻流行的兩層線來表現。頭髮左右對稱地披在兩肩，後頭中央的頭髮被編在一起（參照Fig. 100）。胸口裝飾物下用兩條淺的刻線表示罩衫或汗衫的邊，其中心有胸針或扣子一樣的飾物（斯坦因認爲，是皮膚上挂著有吊墜的鏈子）。外衣到腰部，表示腰帶的突帶以下已殘缺，完全不知下部分是什麽形態。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 76-1"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.52</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Ox’s head, camel and hoopoe</title><title lang="chi-Hant">陶制牡牛、駱駝、戴勝</title><note lang="eng"><p>1st-3rd century A.D.</p><p>From Yotkan</p><p>Pottery</p><p>76-1 (Ox’s head): L. 9.5 cm</p><p>76-1:MAS 52 (Yo. 0023.a)</p><p>76-2(Camel):7.6×8.0 cm</p><p>76-2: MAS 24 (Yo. 008.c)</p><p>76-3(Hoopoe): 10.8×14.2 cm</p><p>76-3: MAS 123 (Yo. 0061)</p><p>The terracotta figurines are by far the most numerous and entertaining of the finds from Yotkan, with large numbers in the British Museum in addition to those acquired by Stein, while other collections are equally large, such as the collection in Leningrad which forms the basis of D’yakonova’s major monograph (N.V.D’yakonova and S.S.Sorokin, 1960).</p><p>The three pieces shown here are among the larger examples, some of the others being minute, for example, the monkeys caricaturing human gestures and antics in Fig. 103.

Despite their small size, they are endowed with liveliness and an attention to characteristic detail. The basic forms are kept simple, as seen here in the legs of the camel. Small stamped or incised strokes add all that is necessary to complete the depiction (see also the hedgehog figurine in Fig. 86). For these strokes the modelers evidently had a number of small wooden tools that could be used singly or in combination-note especially the effective use of a dot and a curved element for the crest and tail of the hoopoe, and their separate use for the different textures of the breast plumage and wing feathers. A ring punch was apparently used for the eye.</p><p>All three figurines are probably simply models or toys.

In Fig. 105 the head on the right is more delicately modelled and incised: the hair on the top of the head is flattened, with a short tail meeting the main plait rising from the back.</p><p>These heads are all very small and of necessity used only the simplest means of depiction, yet the more delicate examples among them are sufficient to enable us to glimpse a sophisticated and elegant society in the Khotan area in the early centuries A.D.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>1～3世紀</p><p>約特幹出土</p><p>陶器</p><p>78－1：（從左）3.3×3.8釐米，3.4×3.9釐米，4.7×4.8釐米</p><p>MAS107，57，66（Yo.0044.c,Yo.0024.a,Yo.0027.a）</p><p>78－2：（從左）4.5×3.9釐米，4.4×3.5釐米</p><p>MAS27，98，（Yo.009.c,Yo.0041.d）</p><p>78－3：（從左）高5.3釐米，6.2釐米，6.5釐米</p><p>MAS33，32，43（Yo.009.h.10,h.5,h.13）</p><p>圖78－1中，進一步展示的約特幹的大壺上貼的面具的千變萬化。其製作方法是先用模子翻製，然後用模壓或刻劃，以最簡單的方式産生最大的誇張效果。</p><p>男性（圖78－2）和女性（圖78－3）的人物面具仍然是使用模子製作，通過各種工具及手段使相貌和表情産生各種不同的變化。這種變化特別在三個女性頭上最爲顯著：左邊像的眼睛是粘貼的，瞳孔和鼻孔上也有洞，嘴角多少顯出面具的特徵。右端像的情況也一樣，只是瞳孔是用環狀物壓的，而中間像的眼睛則是用刻劃的，表現更爲自然。三個頭上都有突出的髮髻，中間像用珠飾束紮髮髻。正如斯坦因的觀察（《西域》，第1卷，107頁），後面的髮型极富變化，這種典型的例子，还可见许多其它頭部的側面圖。Fig. 104左側的像和本圖都同樣有尖角的劉海，但結髮髻的髮端短短的垂下，下面的髮往上结出大的環。右側像的髮型，支着髮髻框、墊著髮墊，有几分華麗，臉頰上有卷毛。Fig. 105右側的頭部，模型和刻劃都很精巧：髮髻在頂部結成平的，短垂的髮端在後邊編結。</p><p>這些頭像都極小，當然只能進行最為簡單的刻劃。儘管如此，從這些精巧的作品之中足以使我們感覺到了昔日和田地區富有經驗而優雅的社會風貌。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 79"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.4</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="san">Vase with appliqué decoration</title><title lang="chi-Hant">粘花壺</title><note lang="eng"><p>1st-3rd century A.D.</p><p>Plate 79</p><p>From Yotkan</p><p>Pottery</p><p>H. 20.0 cm, D. of body 17.5 cm</p><p>MAS 4 (Yo. 01.a)</p><p>The small masks, both grotesque and human, seen in the previous plates were generally intended as applied ornaments for large vessels. Sometimes a fragment of the vessel wall has remained attached to the mask, but whole vessels are extremely rare, scarce enough for the Skrine Collection in the British Museum to contain one fake: a modern vase of lightweight clay with genuine but mismatched ancient handles in animal form.</p><p>The body of the vessel shown in this plate is wheel-made, dense and smooth on the plain surfaces. It was richly ornamented with incised, punched and appliqué decoration. The band of moulded oval rosettes around the widest part, the two human heads, and the pairs of swags in each of the panels on the shoulder are all part of this appliqué decoration. So too would have been the handles, in the form of animals, but these have broken off, and have, along with the neck, been ground down in antiquity so that the vessel might continue to be of some use.</p><p>Numerous examples of such handles, some of them griffin-like with a beaked head, others vaguely leonine or equine in character, and often winged, have been found at Yotkan and are in the major collections. Examples from the Stein Collection are shown in Figs. 106 and 107. One fragment in the British Museum (1902 12-20 361) shows exactly how such animal handles fitted onto the vessel, which was decorated in very similar fashion to the almost complete vase shown here. The animal stands on its hind legs (the two legs merge into one with an incised sketching in of the tail) above the mask on the shoulder; the front legs, also merged into one, are joined to the neck just beneath the flaring rim. The rim itself is flat, and the animal surmounted it so that it faced its opposite across the mouth of the vessel.</p><p>This vase, like al of the Yotkan terracottas, is unglazed, one of the factors arguing for a comparatively early date. The question of date for these finds has been extensively discussed by D’yakonova and Sorokin (1960) and summarized by Gropp (1974, pp. 297-98).</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>1～3世紀</p><p>約特幹出土</p><p>陶器</p><p>高20.0釐米 體經17.5釐米</p><p>MAS 4 （Yo.01.a）</p><p>圖77、78的獸面或人面，原是粘在大的壺上的裝飾。有很多粘著這些裝飾的壺的斷片，但原封不動地完整保留下來的卻極少。大英博物館的Skrine收集品中，有一件經過大量修補而復原的。那是在重新製作的分量較輕的粘土制的壺體上，粘貼了收集來的真正古代的動物形把手，感覺略微有點不相稱。</p><p>本圖展示的壺體，是通過鏇盤成形的，器表細密光滑。上面有刻紋、穿孔、粘貼等華麗的裝飾，粘貼裝飾有壺體最突出部分的帶狀上用模子製作的卵形花紋，有圍繞其上肩部分的葉狀紋，還有兩個人面等。此壺也曾有動物形狀的把手，可能是因已損壞，沿著壺頸把上部砍掉了，之後作爲其它容器仍繼續使用過。</p><p>從約特幹發現的物品中，像這種把手在各地方的收集品中都很多，大多是有嘴的飛獅（有翼的獅子）形狀。除外，還有無法辨別是獅子還是馬的形狀，無論哪一種大多都是有翼的。斯坦因收集的三種收錄在Figs.106、107中。在大英博物館中亞美術的搜集中，還有其他斷片，可清楚看到這種動物形把手被安裝在壺上的方式（Hoernle ，PI.VIII.fig.8:1902 12-20 361）。其斷片的裝飾形式，與本圖中展示的大致完整形狀的壺極相似，動物以後肢（合併在一起，尾巴用刻紋表現）立於壺肩部的人面之上。前肢也一樣合爲一條，安裝在邊口正下方的壺頸部分。壺的邊口平整，兩隻動物隔壺口相對安裝。</p><p>與約特幹所有陶器一樣，此壺也是素陶，沒有加釉子這一點，是推測它們爲較早製品的根據之一。有關這些發掘品的年代問題，D’yakonova 和Sorokin做過概括性的論述（1960），Gropp做過歸納（1974，p.297-298）。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 80"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1907, 1111.37</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Jug</title><title lang="chi-Hant">壺</title><note lang="eng"><p>1st-4th century A.D.</p><p>Acquired at Yotkan</p><p>Pottery with incised decoration</p><p>H. 15.5 cm, D. of body 10.5 cm</p><p>1907 11-11 37 (Yo. 0024)</p><p>This small jug from Yotkan is one of the few whole vessels to come from the site, and shows its classical origins quite clearly, resembling a Greek oenochoe, or wine jug.

Other incised double lines, flanked by dots, run from the shoulder to the neck on either side of the handle and between the shallow arcs.

As Stein observed, this motif occurs frequently among the figurines from Yotkan (Ancient Khotan, Vol. I, p. 207; Vol. II, Pl. XLVII). The remainder of the decoration, however, of six segments each deeply ridged and the shape of the whole ampulla are close to the forms of glass from Bactria (cf. J. Hackin, Recherches Archeologiques a Begram, Paris, 1939, Pl. XI, Fig. 27), where similar decoration is applied by trailing glass of a different colour around the vessel over vertical divisions also of trailed glass. The Bactrian examples date from the first to the third century A.D. and the resemblance of this example in terracotta to such prototypes is one of the factors pointing to a relatively early date for the Yotkan pottery fragments found in large numbers.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>1～4世紀</p><p>約特幹出土</p><p>帶有裝飾的陶器</p><p>高10.6釐米 最大宽9.0釐米</p><p>1907 11－11 39（Yo.0028）</p><p>這小而可愛的陶器，也是斯坦因第一次探險時得到的，只看一眼把手上彈琵琶的猿像，立刻可斷定是約特幹的。就像斯坦因也敍述的那樣，此內容頻繁出現於約特幹陶器上（參照《古代和田》第1卷207頁，第2卷圖版47）。但只就殘存部分而言，其裝飾是用豎的深溝將整體分割成六個區，器形與大夏的玻璃容器（參照“Hackin”圖版XI，插圖27）極相似。那個是把粘貼的玻璃垂直隔開後，再在上面用彩色玻璃圍繞整個容器的相同裝飾。大夏玻璃容器的製作年代是1世紀至3世紀間，而此陶器作品與它們非常相似，這是能把大量發現的約特幹陶器斷片類的年代定位爲早期的論據之一。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 82"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1907, 1111.49</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Mithuna figure</title><title lang="chi-Hant">夫妻雙身像</title><note lang="eng"><p>Post-Gandhara period, 6th-7th century A.D.</p><p>From North-West India; found at Khotan</p><p>Ivory</p><p>H. 7.5 cm</p><p>British Museum, 1907 11-11 49 (Kh. 008)</p><p>This tiny and beautiful ivory mithuna or dampati (figure of husband and wife), found by Stein at Khotan during his first expedition, has been discussed by several scholars (Barrett, 1957; van Lohuizen-de Leeuw, 1959; Chandra, 1957-59; Dwivedi, 1972, 1976). Stein himself thought that it was of Khotanese origin, while others believed it to have come from Kashmir in the post-Gupta period. According to V. P. Dwivedi, however, the ivory is comparable in style with Gandharan art and may have been produced in North-West India in the sixth or seventh century A.D.</p><p>The young man is the best-preserved part of the couple. He wears a long-sleeved tunic belted at the waist, a necklace and earrings. He holds his wife tenderly, his right hand placed above her breasts and the left arm supporting her back. His left hand can be seen just behind her waist and holds a small floral wreath. His wife wears a similar long-sleeved tunic under a short cloak with a fur-lined or embroidered edge. She has lost her head and left arm, but from the back her right arm emerges from the cloak and rests gently on her husband’s shoulder. The lower part of both figures is lost.</p><p>Such a miniature piece, like the ivory shrine now in Gansu with which it has been compared, could easily be transported and shows the way in which styles could travel between places in Central Asia. It may be worth noting that the subject of the loving couple is also found among the Yotkan terracottas in the British Museum (1902 12-20 514). Although somewhat earlier, the model for this piece too may have come to Khotan from India.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>後犍陀羅時期，6～7世紀</p><p>源自印度西北，和田出土</p><p>象牙</p><p>高7.5釐米</p><p>大英博物館,1907 11－11 49（Kh.008）</p><p>小而漂亮的象牙夫妻雙身像或者男女雙身像（夫婦像），是斯坦因第一次探險時從和田發現的，直到現在學者們仍然在討論（Barrett，1957；van Lohuizen-de Leeuw, 1959; Chandra, 1957-59; Dwivedi, 1972, 1976）。斯坦因認爲這是在和田製作的，但其他學者則相信它是在後笈多時期的克什米爾製作的。但是，據V.P.

As at the Tibetan fort at Miran (over 700 miles away by road he observes), Stein found the rubbish deposits still pungent with filth, but full of evidence of the daily life and activities of the Tibetan garrison. Tibetan documents, numbering over a thousand, were the most abundant, but some records were written in both Khotanese and Chinese or Tibetan, showing the administrative need for bilingual communication. Objects found include numerous weapons, wooden seal-cases, wooden keys and locks, wooden dice for games, netting for catching fish in the flood season, and sandals and shoes. Many of the latter were of thick wool or felt, as the one shown here, and were a protection against the severe winter cold. The sole is stitched with close-set rows of hemp string: its edges are turned up all around the shoe, and are further protected by leather patches. The uppers are tightly stitched in a design of overlapping scales, and a draw-string would originally have provided a snug fit around the ankle.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>8世紀末～9世紀中葉</p><p>麻紮塔格出土</p><p>毛、皮</p><p>長25.0釐米</p><p>MAS495（M.Tagh.a.004）</p><p>關於有“聖地之山”意義的麻紮塔格遺迹，斯坦因所指的，是和田河向西北連綿約38公里的山丘，孤立在塔克拉瑪干沙漠中，體現出顯著特徵的遺迹。此地是和田向北方的阿克蘇，貫穿沙漠的唯一的交通道上，平坦的沙漠地帶中最具地利的，所以自然而然成爲于闐國境的駐屯地。</p><p>斯坦因從這裏發現了開元通寶（開元是713～742年，而開元通寶的製作一直延續到唐末），乾元通寶、大曆通寶等，它們與漢文書寫的文書類一同證明，8世紀時這裏曾居住著中國人。然而，發掘品的大部分是出土於寨子的垃圾坑，顯示着吐蕃軍勢力完全佔領該地是8世紀後半葉至9世紀前半葉的年代。據說，斯坦因在距米蘭遺迹約1000公里處發現吐蕃軍砦的垃圾場時，還是臭味撲鼻的狀態，但卻充分證明瞭那是吐蕃守備部隊進行日常活動的地方。</p><p>文書類中，吐蕃文的文獻爲數最多，總數超過1000件，另外于闐文和漢文或吐蕃文對照书写的文書也很多，可窥出因行政上的需要，並記兩國文字進行傳達。</p><p>發掘品中，有無數的武器和印章容器，木製鍵和錠，木製的棋盤，用於洪水季節的漁網，套鞋和靴子等。大多套鞋和靴子，爲了抵禦冬天的嚴寒，像在這裏所展示的那樣，用厚的毛織物或氈子做成。鞋底用麻線縫了幾行，其邊卷上去遮住側面，並貼上皮革作保護。從靴子側面到鞋幫，細細地衲著青海波狀紋，在腳脖處周圍仔細貼體地剪下。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 85"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1928, 1022.197</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Embroidered slipper</title><title lang="chi-Hant">刺繡飾履</title><note lang="eng"><p>6th- 7th century A.D.</p><p>From Gaochang</p><p>Silk embroidery</p><p>L. 22.0 cm</p><p>1928 10-22 197 (Kao.

As large-scale diggings were not possible, owing to preparations for spring sowing in the local villages, he concentrated on trial diggings that would give him some idea of the conditions in which finds brought by villagers might have been discovered. For one of these trials he chose a large ruined stupa, conspicuous in a group of tombs outside the north-east corner of the walled city. Its circular chamber, once domed, was enclosed by a thick wall outside which was a narrow passage, lit by windows in an outer wall, and containing fine fragments of wall painting.</p><p>The beautifully worked slipper shown in this plate was one of a pair discovered in this passage near a hoard of metal objects, which had been deposited there when the passage was already partly filled with fallen debris. The hoard contained metal objects of everyday use and sixty-one Chinese copper coins of the Tang and Song dynasties, the latest being of the Chongning period (A.D. 1102-7), providing an approximate date for the deposit in the first quarter of the twelfth century.</p><p>The slipper is joined down the centre at the heel and toe and is made up of many superimposed layers of fabric, the sole being constructed of layers of hemp cloth, tightly quilted like the rest of the slipper.

Wenwu, 1972/1, p. 23). They have been studied in detail by Aki Uyeno (1974). Some, like the funerary banners of the Western Han dynasty found at Mawangdui near Changsha, are T-shaped, with extra half-widths of silk sewn on at the top of the painting to accommodate the upper bodies of the couple; sometimes, as with the present example, these side pieces are simply wider at the top and taper gradually towards the bottom. Here the main piece of silk is 47.5 cm wide and the side pieces taper from about 22 cm to about 13 cm.</p><p>All of the banners are similar in iconography, but they do present a number of minor differences. The present instance is unusual in that Nu Wa is on the right, in the place usually taken by Fu Xi. She holds a pair of scissors (?), and he the set-square ruled with divisions in white. The thumb and clenched fingers of Fu Xi’s right hand, and of the left hand of Nu Wa, can each be seen at the nape of the neck of the other. Between the attributes there is a sun disc surrounded by a ring of stars. In other versions the sun disc bears a bird instead of radiating lines, or the ring of stars may be missing. Other stars, often linked by lines into constellations, generally appear down the sides of the banner. Here they are separate white spots, liberally scattered wherever there is room around the figures. Fu Xi and Nu Wa appear to share the same coat and short pleated tunic, but only the outline of the tunic and its long sleeves can be seen, the colour having evidently damaged the silk beneath it. Below the skirt, their serpentine bodies are closely entwined above the moon, which is depicted in exactly the same way as the sun above, without any distinction even in colour. Other banners, however, show this lower disc clearly as the moon by its white colour. There is much variation, to, in the number of times the bodies intertwine-here three times, but in other cases only once or twice.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，6～7世紀</p><p>阿斯塔那出土</p><p>絹繪</p><p>高216.0釐米,寬91.5釐米</p><p>大英博物館,Ast.v.l.02</p><p>繪著想象中的神格化的蛇身纏繞的伏羲女媧的絹或麻布的幡，在6世紀初至7世紀中葉間的阿斯塔那，是葬禮時作爲墓室裝飾用的獨特的物品，相同的作品還有大量的發現（參照《文物》1972/1，23頁），Aki Uyeno（上野アキ）有詳述的論述（參照《美術研究》，1974，Nos.292、293）。長沙近郊馬王堆發現的西漢帛畫，也有同樣的T型的作品，但它只是因下方兩旁的絹已脫落而偶然造成一致的，原來是如本圖中所見的那樣，上端寬，下方逐漸狹窄的形狀。那是因爲，中央是用一整幅的絹，其左右拼接的是斜裁的絹，並將寬的一端接在上面。本圖中央的絹寬47.5釐米，兩側的絹上邊約22釐米，下邊約13釐米。</p><p>畫面結構基本相同，細部表現則各有異，例如女媧本應在右邊，而伏羲通常在這個位置。女媧舉著剪刀（？），伏羲舉白色有刻度的曲尺。伏羲右手和女媧左手，握拳的手指分別在彼此的脖頸後露出。兩者間配有星圈環繞的日輪，有的作品則繪鳥來代替日輪放射線，有的則不繪星輪。除了環繞日輪的星星外，畫面兩側還有許多星星，大多時候，它們被線連接起來成星座狀。但在這裏，白色小圓狀的星星，七零八落散佈在畫像周圍的空間裏。伏羲和女媧共用上衣和有褶子的束腰短裙，上衣部分由於上彩使用的顔料有腐蝕作用，絹已損壞，肩和長袖部分的輪廓線也是勉強殘留。裙子下有相互纏繞的蛇身，其下方繪有月輪，與上方的日輪完全相同，顔色上也很難區別。其他作品中，下方的圓盤是白色的，可明顯看出應該是月亮。另外，蛇身的纏繞回數也各不相同，本圖中的是三回，也有一回或兩回的情況。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 87"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1928, 1022.102</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Figurine of a woman</title><title lang="chi-Hant">婦人像木俑</title><note lang="eng"><p>Gaochang kingdom (A.D. 499-640)</p><p>From Astana</p><p>Painted wood</p><p>H. 22.5 cm</p><p>British Museum,1928 10－22 102（Ast.vi.4.04）</p><p>The wooden and clay figurines from Gaochang are important as representatives of the precursors of Tang glazed figurines of the seventh and eighth centuries. In this example the form is carved with a minimum of detail, the lower part being simply a tapering rectangular oblong with the edges chamfered. The painting is the same front and back, a black jacket over a green skirt, both bearing florets in white. At the neck the undershirt of striped red and green is just visible. Later, in the Tang dynasty, more sophisticated figurines from Astana were made with a painted clay head on a wooden body, or were elaborately dressed in actual silks (cf. Xinjiang chutu wenwu, Pls. 121, 129).</p><p>Along with a number of other wooden figurines and two wooden caskets, one of which is shown in Pl. 93, this figure was found in an isolated tomb in the northern part of the Astana cemetery. According to Stein, the conical roof of the chamber was cut in the form of two superimposed squares, and the smooth walls were whitewashed and painted to a height of about a metre in a succession of panels around three sides of the chamber. No photographs were taken, but the scene on the main wall, facing the entrance, featured “a man seated on a carpet, his wife and her three attendants facing him, and three servants approaching from behind with offerings” (Innermost Asia, Vol. Ⅱ, p. 661). Other subjects included guardian monsters, domestic animals, a woman preparing food, and so on, recalling the favourite themes for tomb decoration from the Eastern Han dynasty onwards. The bomb was not dated, but Ast. vi. 1 nearby, with a similar chamber roof, contained a wooden tablet with a date corresponding to A.D. 365, so the tomb may date from the Gaochang period (A.D. 499-640) or even earlier.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>高昌國時期（499～640年）</p><p>阿斯塔那出土</p><p>繪木</p><p>高22.5釐米</p><p>大英博物館,1928 10－22 102（Ast.vi.4.04）</p><p>高昌國時期的木俑或泥俑是7～8世紀的唐三彩的先驅，具有重要的意義。看本圖的木俑，細部雕刻簡單到最小极限，到了下半身，略寬的裙裾只不過是用立體六角方形來表現。背面也有色彩，綠、赤色的裙和黑上衣的兩面均散著白色小花。領子處露出內衣的紅、綠色的縞。以後，到了唐代，阿斯塔那的木俑卻失去了這種簡單素樸的風格，製作的是木身上安裝彩塑的頭部，身纏真絹做的華麗衣裳等作品（參照《新疆出土文物》圖版121、129）。</p><p>此木俑發現于阿斯塔那墓地北邊孤立的古墓中，從那裏出土的多是木俑及兩個木製的舍利容器，其中一個展示在圖93中。據斯坦因講，該古墓的天井是錐體形狀，墓室的三面牆壁上塗著白色壁土，約1米的高度上繪著像牆裙一樣排列的壁畫。沒有拍攝照片，其裏側牆壁的繪畫“是一個男性坐在地毯上，其妻子和三位侍女與他相對，還有三個侍者端著貢物從背後走近”（《亞洲腹地》，卷2，661頁）。其它壁面，題材包括有守護神、家畜、準備食物的婦女等，使人想到漢代以後盛行的墓葬裝飾內容。此墓沒有紀年，但從天井形式相同，出土了升平八年（365年）木簡的阿斯塔那第vi區1號墓看，大概是高昌國時期（499～640年），或更早一些。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 88"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1928, 1022.110</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Pedestal bowl</title><title lang="chi-Hant">高腳杯</title><note lang="eng"><p>Gaochang kingdom (A.D. 499-640) 6th century A.D.

A very similar pedestal bowl is the centerpiece of a group of vessels illustrated in Chosen kobijutsu taikan (Nara, 1930, Vol. Ⅲ, Pl. 76). These vessels, like some of those found by Stein, were arranged on a low oblong tray with curved ends and projecting handles, supported on low feet. This arrangement recalls that of the lacquer wine cups and vessels for a funeral wake in the lower part of the famous silk banner painting from tomb No. 1 at Mawangdui (Xi Han bo hua, Pl. 10), and more distantly, that of ritual bronze vessels of the Shang and Western Zhou, such as the famous set from Baoji xian acquired by the Metropolitan Museum in 1901. Naturally, the tomb furnishings at Astana, given the restrictions of local materials and workmanship, were on a very much humbler scale. The faceted tapering stem of this bowl is cousin to the simple tapered wooden figure seen in Pl. 87, and the colours used for both are largely the same.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>高昌國（499～640年）時代（6世紀？）</p><p>阿斯塔那出土</p><p>彩陶</p><p>高16.7釐米 口徑11.5釐米 底徑10.2釐米</p><p>1928 10－22 110（Ast.i 1.05）</p><p>此灰陶高腳杯上所見的由大白點和紅刷毛紋組成的裝飾，不僅在陶器上，還包括木製品（參照Figs. 118～120）上，是阿斯塔那出土的隨葬品上的典型裝飾。底部、腰部和碗部，大概是各自分別製作後連接上的。</p><p>《朝鮮古美術大觀》（奈良1930年，第3卷76圖）一圖的一群冥器中央，可見與此非常相似的高腳杯。那些冥器和斯坦因發現的幾件相同，邊往外翻，把手突出，有低腳，擺在橢圓形的矮盆上。那配置使人想起以絹繪著稱的馬王堆1號墓（參照《西漢帛畫》圖版10）中，放在絹繪下方的漆器酒杯和冥器之類，以及都會美術館於1901從寶雞縣獲得的，一套有名的商及西周時期的祭禮用青銅器等。</p><p>阿斯塔那墓的隨葬品，顯然是利用當地出產的材料製作於當地的，套具的尺寸都不大。此高腳杯的有棱面且漸變成細的腳，與圖87彩色木偶下半身的製作相似，似乎彩色顔料也相同。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 89-1"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1928, 1022.94</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Two ducks</title><title lang="chi-Hant">木製彩色家鴨</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, first half of the 7th century A.D.</p><p>From Astana</p><p>Painted wood</p><p>Left: L. 15.0 cm, W. 7.0 cm, H. 6.0 cm</p><p>Right: L. 14.4 cm, W. 7.0 cm, H. 5.6 cm</p><p>1928 10-22 94,95 (Ast. i. 1. 012, Ast. i. 3. 021)</p><p>These two ducks, among others found by Stein in early seventh century tombs at Astana (cf.

Since other tombs in the group Ast. i contained funerary tablets dated A.D. 608, 632 and 646, the dating of the group as a whole is quite clear.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，7世紀前半葉</p><p>阿斯塔那出土</p><p>長15.0釐米 寬7.0釐米 高6.0釐米</p><p>長14.4釐米 寬7.0釐米 高5.6釐米</p><p>1928 10－22 94，95（Ast.i.1.012,Ast.i.3.021）</p><p>這裏列舉的木製家鴨，是斯坦因從阿斯塔那7世紀初期的古墓（參照《亞洲腹地》681，707頁）發現的若干隻中的兩隻。使用毫無多餘的簡潔雕刻和彩色來表現，下部成舟形，看似漂浮在水面上。還有一件也是發現於阿斯塔那的高昌國時期的作品，與此尺寸相同，但它體內是掏空的（參照《新疆出土文物》圖版76）。這應是死者想把生前自家飼養的家畜類帶到墓裏供養的物品之一。</p><p>發現本圖家鴨的兩個墓，位於阿斯塔那古墓群的東北角，小的矩形墓室，朝東南方向的門開著，沒有塋圈。據說從這些墓室裏，除發現了木製酒杯和缽等外，還發現大量絹料，死者的臉部用絹覆蓋著，眼睛上帶著銀的眼罩。另外，在包括阿斯塔那第i區3號墓兩身中的一身在內的數軀骸骨中，嘴裏均塞著金的薄片。這是君士坦丁一世（527～565年）時期金幣的仿造品，在中國出現金幣以前，拜占廷其他仿造幣，被用作死者的口中的含物。從阿斯塔那第i區的其他墓中，出土了有608年、632年、646年紀年的墓誌，此整個墓區的年代大致是在此前後。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 90"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current"></idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Epitaph tablet (muzhiming)</title><title lang="chi-Hant">墓誌</title><note lang="eng"><p>Dated A.D. 571</p><p>From Astana</p><p>Clay with incised and painted characters</p><p>H. 38.5 cm, W. 40.0 cm</p><p>British Museum,Ast. 09</p><p>This tablet was brought to Stein by villagers of Astana. It is one of five memorial tablets which he took to London, three of the others having been found in situ in the tombs. Still others, which he reburied together in the entrance passage to one of the tombs (Innermost Asia, Vol. Ⅱ, p. 1032), have recently been recovered in a Chinese excavation (Wenwu, 1975/7, p. 10, Figs. 5, 6), six of them with his identifying numbers still intact.</p><p>In common with others found at Astana, this tablet substitutes clay tile for the stone commonly used in North China for muzhiming. Various colour combinations are used for the inscriptions and the ground on which they are written, red on black being a favourite combination. The present example is alone in having the characters deeply carved as well, their style still recalling that of the Northern Wei in its forthright character. Particularly noticeable is the wedge-like appearance of the strokes, especially the angled strokes. Such features are directly comparable with several of the early sixth century inscriptions in the Guyang cave at Longmen (cf. Shodo zenshu, Vol. 6, Tokyo, 1966, Pl. 43ff). The orthography of certain characters also shows features that can be paralleled in Northern Wei epitaphs, as in the distinctive form of character Yuan in the name of the deceased (cf. ibid., Pl. 151). Not surprisingly, this tablet is the earliest of the dated tablets found by Stein. The inscription, first translated by Henri Maspero (Innermost Asia, Vol. Ⅱ, Appendix A), reads as follows:</p><p>Yanchang, 11 th year, xinmao, third moon beginning moushen, eighth day, yimao, epitaph of the Administrative Counsellor, later Superior Administrator in the Board of Population, Wang Yuanzhi, posthumously entitled Senior Secretary.</p><p>Other tablets of later date (Figs. 114-16) are simply written with the brush, in red on black, black on white, or red on blue, while their writing styles range from running script to a more formal lishu with each character placed in its own ruled square or rectangle. The surface, especially on those with a white or blue ground, is prone to abrasion, and, with the exception of the tablet shown in this plate, all have suffered considerably since their discovery.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>延昌十一年（571年）題記</p><p>阿斯塔那出土</p><p>著色磚銘</p><p>高38.5釐米,寬40.0釐米</p><p>大英博物館,Ast.09</p><p>此墓誌是斯坦因從阿斯塔那的村民那裏獲得的。包括此墓誌在內，斯坦因帶回倫敦的墓誌共有五種，其中三塊是從墓室內發現的。除此外，最近中國的考古隊也發現了斯坦因埋回墓道（參照《亞洲腹地》，卷2，1032頁）的墓誌（參照《文物》1975年第7期，10頁，插圖5、6），其中六塊上有斯坦因標的號，很清晰。</p><p>中原的墓誌按慣例一般都採用石材，而此墓誌與阿斯塔那出土的其他墓誌一樣採用磚。墓誌的銘文和磚的底色間色彩配合有各種各樣的，黑地上配朱書似乎特別受喜愛。本圖的例子是唯一一塊將碑文刻得很深的墓誌，同時，純樸的筆風使人想起北魏的書體。特別惹眼的是楔形筆法，有棱角的部位隨處可見。這種特點使人立刻想起龍門石窟古陽洞6世紀初的若干題記（參照《書道全集》第6卷，圖版42以後，東京，1968年）。另外，若干文字的特點，如死者姓名中的“元”字的字形等，明顯與北魏墓誌有類似之處（上揭書，圖版151）。實際上此墓誌在斯坦因發現的墓誌中是最早的。馬伯樂最早譯釋了這件墓誌銘（《亞洲腹地》第2卷附錄A），全文如下：</p><p>延昌十一年辛卯歲三</p><p>月朔戊申八日乙卯諮</p><p>議參軍轉民部司</p><p>馬追贈長史王元祉（？）</p><p>之墓表</p><p>年代稍晚的其他墓誌（參照Figs.114-116）只用筆寫的，有黑地朱書、黑地白書、青地朱書等例子。書體從行書體，到一字一字寫在整齊劃出的方形或長方形的格子中的隸書體，各種各樣的。墓誌表面，特別是白地或青地的容易磨損，除有題銘的本圖中的墓誌外，其它的在發現當時就已經破損嚴重了。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 91"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1928, 1022.117</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Figurine of a horse</title><title lang="chi-Hant">馬俑</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, mid-8th century A.D.</p><p>From Astana</p><p>Clay and wood, painted and with pieces of silk</p><p>H. 60.5 cm, L. 79.0 cm</p><p>British Museum,1928 10-22 117 (Ast. iii.2. 057)</p><p>The tombs in the cemetery at Astana share in a modest way the principal features of the great eighth-century Tang tombs near Chang’an. Ast iii was a group of ten tombs within a rectangular enclosure, all with their entrances to the south-west. Tomb iii. 2, from which this noble figure of a horse was recovered, had two small antechambers, the inner one with rounded niches for clay figures (Innermost Asia, Vol. Ⅲ, Pl. 33). Two saddled horses and a camel were found in the eastern niche, and a number of smaller horses with riders in the other: none of these are in the British Museum collection, but a detached pair of legs from a rider in scale-armour are shown in Fig. 121 and show how these were elaborately attired (cf. the complete figure of horse and rider in Xinjiang chutu wenwu, Pl. 123). In addition, the tomb contained splendid guardian figures of earth spirits (ibid., Fig. 325), and the body itself was wrapped in figured or painted silk. A coin of the Kaiyuan period (A.D. 713-42) was found in the approach corridor, but further evidence of the eighth-century date of the whole group was provided by documents, cut up and re-used as funeral garments, which were recovered from some of the tombs.</p><p>The documents, from tombs Ast. iii. 3 and 4, were thoroughly investigated by Henri Maspero, and published posthumously (Les documents chinois de la troisième expédition de Sir Aurel Stein en Asie Centrale, London, 1953), although he was able to communicate his early findings to Stein in time for the publication of Innermost Asia. Several of them proved to be portions of registers of horses in the postal and administrative service, recording in detail the age, colour, sex, marks, scars and general condition of each horse; others recorded official enquiries that took place whenever a horse died en route. A number of the documents contain dates, ranging from A.D. 669 to A.D. 722. From these Maspero was able to reconstruct the whole organization of Communications in the area, the day-to-day accounting for provisions, and the prescribed penalties for injuries to the animals arising from neglect or overloading (cf. Maspero, 1953, pp. 82-92).</p><p>Gaochang, the walled city close by which is the ancient cemetery of Astana, was a vital centre of communications after this point since the road from Chang’an divided at Yarkhoto (Jiaocheng) to run north to Ting and south-west to Karashahr. When the Tang conquered the Gaochang kingdom in A.D. 640m, the headquarters was first established at Yarkhoto, but when control was reestablished in 657 after Turkish reprisals in 651, Yarkhoto had been destroyed, and Kucha became the seat of the Protector-General as it had been in the Han dynasty. At Gaochang, the brother of the last Gaochang king was appointed Governor-General of Xizhou (the Western District), and Gaochang remained the centre of administration until its destruction by the Tibetans in A.D. 791.</p><p>Many of the horses in the registers are described as having a bay coat, some with spotted markings. Here, in addition to the markings on the haunches, neck and forequarters, there are petal-shaped pieces of silk attached to the body of the horse. The saddle blanket is represented as magnificently embroidered, and there are even remnants of silk from which hung the stirrups. A pair of stirrups, large open loops with a projection at the top pierced to receive the stirrup leather, were found separately and probably came from this horse or its companion, now in New Delhi. Like all of the figures in the tomb, the wooden legs were prolonged so that they could be fixed in the floor of the niche. This would have been necessary as the solid construction of the figure makes it very heavy. With its small head set on a powerful tapering neck, it is a fine representation of the horses imported by the Chinese since the Han dynasty.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代（8世紀中葉）</p><p>阿斯塔那出土</p><p>泥塑彩繪，木芯，絲綢</p><p>高60.5釐米,長79.0釐米</p><p>大英博物館,1928 10－22 117（Ast.iii.2.057）</p><p>阿斯塔那古墓與長安近郊同時代（8世紀，唐代）的墓相比，要素樸簡單的多。阿斯塔那第iii區是由長方形的10個古墓組成，入口均朝西南邊。發現此精美馬俑的第iii區2號墓裏有兩個小前室，在每個內部圓形的龕裏都裝著俑（參照《亞洲腹地》，卷3，圖33）。東側的龕裏有兩個韝鞍的馬俑和一個駱駝俑，西側的龕裏還發現了很多略小一點的馬俑和騎士。它們都未收藏在大英博物館，有一對穿鎧甲的騎馬人物的腿，作爲服裝的參考資料展現於Fig. 121（有關穿鎧甲的騎士像的完整形象，參照《新疆出土文物》，圖123）。在此墓中還發現了身體用錦或彩繪絹包著的華麗鎮墓獸（參照上揭書Fig. 325）。從墓道中發現了開元（713～742年）通寶，而比這更能確證此墓群是8世紀建造的，是從若干墓中發現的文書類，它們是被斷開後再做成葬衣的。</p><p>有關從阿斯塔那第iii區的3號及4號墓出土的文書，馬伯樂做過深入研究。早期的研究成果，趕上了《亞洲腹地》的出版，而全部整理刊行則在作者去世後(Les documents chinois de la troisième expédition de Sir Aurel Stein en Asie Centrale, London, 1953)。文書大多是有關郵差或官吏使用馬匹的登錄，記錄年齡、毛色、性別、特徵、傷迹等馬狀態的文書占大多數。如馬在途中猝死，記錄則公式化。相當數目的文書上都有紀年，其年代在669至722年間。通過這些記錄，馬伯樂重構了當地的通信組織、每日飼料用量，以及針對因爲不注意以及超載對動物造成傷害所下達的懲罰規定等（參照上揭書82～92頁）。</p><p>連接阿斯塔那古墓的高昌故城是交通要地，從長安出發的道路通過這裏，到交河故城分成兩路，向北是庭州，向西南行則到焉耆，是極充滿活力的貿易中心，非常繁榮。640年唐朝征服高昌國時，最初曾把軍事機構設在交河故城。651年，由於突厥的報復，交河故城潰滅，其後657年再次納入唐朝的統治下。而且按漢代的制度，在庫車設置了西域都護府，任命最後一個高昌國王的弟弟爲西州都護，直到791年受吐蕃的破壞，高昌一直是作爲唐朝西域行政要地而存在。</p><p>根據登錄簿，大多馬的毛色爲栗色，不過也記錄有斑點的馬。本圖馬俑的肩胛、脖子和胸部上都貼著用絹裁成的花瓣形。鞍韉上有刺繡般的華麗文樣，吊馬鐙用的絹的斷片也保留了下來。大概是與此馬俑等一同發現的一對馬鐙，穿革帶的突起部位，現在新德里國立博物館收藏。和其它俑相同，此馬的腿也是固定在龕內的板上，因此裏邊做了很長的木芯。為使俑像結實，因此有必要這樣處理。強有力的脖子是上邊細，安裝了小的頭部。這可以說是漢代之後，中國引進良馬的一個典型的說明。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 92"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1928, 1022.120</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Figurine of a woman</title><title lang="chi-Hant">婦人泥俑</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 8th century A.D.</p><p>From Astana</p><p>Painted clay on wood core</p><p>H. 25.5 cm</p><p>1928 10-22 120 (Ast. x. 1. 011)</p><p>Ast. x. 1 was the last of the tombs examined by Stein at Astana, and proved to have contained clay figurines similar to those found in Ast. iii. 2 (cf. the large clay horse of the preceding plate).

Some examples are square, with the lid in the shape of a truncated pyramid, but most are circular, with a conical lid. The decoration is much simpler than the majority of those found, and the box itself is smaller, so it may have served a different purpose.

In antiquity all of the many shrines, with the exception of a series of caves, had been destroyed by fire, and had largely collapsed inwards. The fire, as well as being destructive, had a preservative effect upon parts of the stucco ornament of the shrines, especially in the case of the heads of many figures, which had been made with greater care and attention than the limbs and bodies. By and large, wall paintings did not survive, with the exception of fragments from one shrine. Apart from small fragments, the pieces shown here and in the following plates are the only items of wall painting from the Stein Collection now in the British Museum; the rest are all in New Delhi.</p><p>The fragments come from a temple in the northwestern part of the site, the only recognizable part of a complex of halls and rooms. When examined by Stein, he thought that the entrance hall had in fact already been partially cleared. However, although Grunwedel had earlier visited the site in Jone 1906 (Grunwedel, 1912, p. 191ff), Oldenburg was later to recover more paintings from this same entrance hall (see below). Beyond the entrance hall was a cella five metres square, the entrance of which had once been flanked by a statue on each side. The cella itself was filled with burnt brickwork; on its east and west sides vaulted passages led to a narrow chamber, also vaulted, behind the cella. It was in this narrow vaulted chamber, designated xiii by Stein, that the paintings shown here were found. They formed a continuous dado along the foot of the outer wall for about three and a half metres in the eastern half of the chamber. Stein also recovered one panel (Mi. xiii. 10) from the western passage, which had been blocked by debris before the fire. This panel is also in the British Museum, but the surface has deteriorated since it was reproduced in Serindia (Pl. CXXIV).</p><p>The series of panels begins with scenes of monks receiving instruction. The senior monks, some of them clearly aged (Pl. 95-2), are seated on square stools, some with closed-in sides, others open showing the legs and stretchers, and incorporating a foot-rest. Their pupils, on the other hand, kneel in front of them. In the first scene (Pl. 95-1), both master and pupils are writing on tablets, which have the long narrow shape of pothi leaves. In the sky above, a descending apsaras brings a writing brush, in an interesting variation on the more usual theme of scattering flowers (Pl. 95-2). In another scene, the figure descending on clouds from above appears from his dress to be a Buddha; below him two groups of monks and devatas kneel in adoration (Pl. 95-4). Another scene, only partially preserved, shows a monk prostrating himself in front of his master, in a gesture reminiscent of the Vow before Dipankara (Pl. 95-8; cf. Pl. 117).</p><p>Despite the colourfulness of this series of panels, they are easily outshone by the two larger panels recovered from the same shrine by Oldenburg, which are now displayed in the Hermitage Museum, Leningrad. They are reproduced in colour in his report (Oldenburg, 1914, Pls. IX, X). One of them shows a lady of high rank, apparently in great grief, as she raises her hand to her face. Nearby kneels a small boy in typical Uighur costume. They are both just behind a very much larger figure of the Buddha. The other panel, which must have been on the other side of the doorway in the main hall of the shrine, shows two Bodhisattvas and a number of monks, some of them kneeling. Both paintings are very finely drawn and lavishly coloured, and gold is used quite extensively. By comparison, the Stein panels, occupying a relatively humble and obscure position low on the rear wall of the rear chamber of the shrine, are correspondingly muted in both colouring and subject matter. They are, however, extremely important since the landscape settings still preserve elements that must derive from the art of the Kizil caves. Each of the monks seated and transcribing texts is placed in a niche or cave within a hill whose contours rise in a series of rounded steps, outlined in ink (Pls. 95-10, 11). The hills are lined up one beside the other, and a second row is seen above them. It is principally the stepped contour of the hills that recalls the ceilings of many of the Kizil caves, where jataka stories are illustrated in a landscape setting of stylized hills, repeated over the whole roof vault. Although the arrangement in the Ming-oi panels is not continuous so as to fill the whole space, there are other similarities as well, namely the occasional tree or animal seen around the edges or the hills (Pl. 95-11). Thus while the costume and hair fashion of the small kneeling boy (Pl. 95-6) is clear evidence of the Uighur dating of these paintings, at the latest they are eighth or ninth century.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>回鶻時期，8～9世紀</p><p>焉耆（明屋）出土</p><p>石膏彩繪</p><p>大英博物館,Mi.xiii.1~9、11、12</p><p>參照Figs.161、162</p><p>斯坦因採用當地語言“明屋（千家）”命名的此遺址，在焉耆向南約60公里處，散佈在碩爾楚克北面的山地裏。除石窟外，許多寺院在古代都曾遭受過火災，向里倒塌。當然，火災有帶來破壞的一面，但也有有利的一面，寺院用灰泥裝飾部分，特別是佛像頭部，它比軀體、手腳製作的更認真，燃燒使之變得更結實，起到了保護的效果。除了一個寺院的一個壁畫殘片外，壁畫幾乎都沒有留下。另外，斯坦因收集的壁畫，藏在大英博物館的，除了極小的斷片外，大概只有本圖所展示的作品了，其它都收藏在新德里。</p><p>本圖的壁畫是在位于遺迹西北部只剩大廳和幾閒屋的佛寺中發現的。斯坦因認爲，在自己開始考察之前，入口的大廳曾有人涉足。而格倫威德爾訪問此地是1906年6月（參照Grunwedel：Alt-Buddhistische Kultstutten in Chinesische-Turkistan 1912,191頁），後奧登堡從此入口的大廳發現了另一壁畫（見下）。入口的大廳深處有5米見方的正方形内殿，其門兩側似乎有過塑像。佛堂本身被燒塌的瓦礫埋沒，其東西兩端是帶拱形天井的側廊，通向同樣有拱形天井的佛堂背後狹小的內室。本圖展示的壁畫是，從斯坦因命名爲xiii的此有拱形天井的狹小內室發現的。壁畫是內室外壁東側一半約3.5米長的牆圍子。斯坦因還從火災之前就被堆積層堵塞的西邊側廊發現了一面壁畫（Mi.xiii.10）。那壁畫也收藏于大英博物館，其畫面狀態比當時《西域》（參照圖CXXI V）中展示時的還要惡化。</p><p>壁畫首先從多個比丘聽授教法的場景開始。年長的比丘腰倚方形的凳子，能明顯能看出年齡（第95－2圖）等，有的腳被斜向橫過的裝飾遮隱，而大多數連放腳或腿的臺子都被描繪出來。另一面，弟子們在前面屈膝而坐。第一場景（第95－3圖）中，無論師父還是弟子都在細長的菩提葉上寫字。上空繪著散花的飛天手持毛筆（圖95－2）。而在另一場景中，從上空乘雲飛來的像是偏袒右肩的佛，其下有兩組比丘和天部在合掌贊頌（圖95－4）。另一場景只保存了一部分，可辨出師父前匍匐的虔誠比丘的身姿（圖95－5）。此景象，使人想起布髮本生的場面（參照圖117）。</p><p>此連環壁畫儘管色彩豐富，但遠不及奧登堡從同一佛寺發現現存于艾爾米塔什美術館的兩幅大壁畫。在其報告中刊載了那兩幅壁畫的彩色圖版（參照Oldenburg，Russkays Turkestanskaya Ekspedit-siya.Goda,1909~1910,1914,圖版IX,X）。其中一面上，有手貼在臉，沈浸於深深地悲哀中的貴族女性，旁邊跪著穿典型回鶻裝的少年，兩人的背後立著極大的佛像。另一面壁畫無疑與主室門口的其它壁畫不同，那裏描繪的是兩身菩薩和數身比丘，有幾個比丘是跪姿。兩面都是精致的描繪，使用了華麗的色彩，還加了大量的金彩。</p><p>相比之下，斯坦因的壁畫也許是描繪在內室內壁下部這一既不重要也不顯眼的場所，色彩和主題都稍差。但在此壁畫可以看出克孜爾石窟壁畫風格的山水描繪，這一點很重要。比丘各自坐在山中的石窟或佛龕中抄寫經文。山的輪廓用墨繪成圓頭的臺階狀(圖 95-10, 11)。那山排成一列，其上方可見第二列。臺階狀的山的輪廓使人想起克孜爾石窟的多數天井畫。克孜爾石窟裏，半球形的整面天井上，描繪著以模式化的山水爲背景的本生圖。明屋壁畫上的山水雖然不是連续遮掩整面，但還能見到其他類似點，就是那些山上隨處可見的樹和動物等（圖95－11）的描繪。跪拜的少年（圖95－8）的衣服和髮型也能够證明此連環的壁畫是回鶻時期的，其年代最遲不過8～9世紀。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 96"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.1012</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Figure of a devata</title><title lang="chi-Hant">天部塑像</title><note lang="eng"><p>6th- 7th century A.D.</p><p>From Ming-oi</p><p>Stucco</p><p>H.47.0 cm</p><p>British Museum,MAS 1012 (Mi. xi. 002)</p><p>See Plate 97</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>6～7世紀</p><p>焉耆（明屋）出土</p><p>泥塑</p><p>高47.0釐米</p><p>大英博物館,MAS1012（Mi.xi.002）</p><p>參照圖97。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 97"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.1011</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Figure of a devata</title><title lang="chi-Hant">天部塑像</title><note lang="eng"><p>6th- 7th century A.D.</p><p>From Ming-oi</p><p>Stucco</p><p>H.31.5 cm</p><p>British Museum,MAS 1011 (Mi. xi. 001)</p><p>This pair of devatas are among the most complete of the hundreds of figures found by Stein in the cella of a ruined temple at Ming-oi, not far from the one containing the wall paintings of the preceding plate. Stein dated them and most of the other stuccos from the site to the eighth century, on the basis of coins placed near the images, which were dated to the Dali (A.D. 766-79) and Jianzhong (A.D. 780-83) reigns (Serindia, Vol. Ⅲ, p. 1194). In the museum’s own display, they were dated even later, as eighth-to tenth-century pieces. Had it not been for the presence of these coins, Stein would have dated the images considerably earlier, but he felt that the numismatic evidence was conclusive and that the earlier style of the figures could be sufficiently accounted for by the discovery of moulds, which could have continued in use for centuries.</p><p>As we have just seen in Pl. 95, there is no doubt that the Ming-oi site, with its extensive group of temples, was still in use in the Uighur period, since the costumes of the donors from the wall paintings are unmistakable. But the use of wall paintings as the principal decoration in this temple suggests that there had been a shift away from moulded stucco decorations, as the two media are not easily combined. Besides, coins could have been deposited by worshippers for as long as the temple remained accessible, and while the roofs of the shrines remained intact. Even after the collapse of the roofs, many unfired figures survived with their colouring until the present time. These considerations may allow us to establish the date of the figures according to their style, which is still close to the art of Gandhara. A later style. Showing Chinese influence, can also be identified in the stucco figures of some of the shrines, such as the Bodhisattva head of Pl. 102.</p><p>In composition too, to judge by the sheer numbers of figures and the way that they were closely packed together (some groups still in situ are illustrated in photographs taken by Oldenburg, 1914, Pls. Ⅲ-Ⅴ), the relief decoration of the Ming-oi temples must have been comparable to that of Gandhara. Plate 96 shows some of these features in a single devata. Moulding was used extensively to give such figures their perfection of expression, with smooth and regular features, and for the appliqué scarves and ornaments. The devata is broken off at the knees, but Fig. 140 allows us to see the proportions of the long and slender legs of a similar piece. All are built up of layers of clay applied to a core of reeds bound in a bundle, over which the moulded form fitted as a final layer. Fire has destroyed the reed core, leaving only the impression of this and its binding, and has totally removed the original colouring, but at the same time it has hardened the clay and ensured its survival. The scarf around the shoulders frames the figure and masks the join to the wall, as with the next figure. Changes in attitude were probably made by adjusting the still-moist impression as taken from the mould, as was certainly done with many of the small heads shown in Pls. 104-9.</p><p>Some actual moulds for small parts of figures are in the Stein Collection. One, Mi. iv. 001 (Fig. 148), is for casting a small single seated figure of the Buddha, two curls of hair, and two zig-zag locks (Serindia, Vol. Ⅳ, Pl. CXXXVII). Far more spectacular are the moulds made for the whole upper body and head of comparatively large figures, which are among the finds made by Oldenburg at Kucha and are now displayed in the Hermitage Museum, Leningrad. More than thirty moulds were found at Ming-oi by Grunwedel and Le Coq (Grunwedel, 1912, p. 192). These moulds, like the one just referred to in the Stein Collection, are of plaster of Paris.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>6～7世紀</p><p>焉耆（明屋）出土</p><p>泥塑</p><p>高31.5釐米</p><p>大英博物館,MAS1011（Mi.xi.001）</p><p>斯坦因於明屋遺址發現上圖壁畫的寺的附近的一個寺址中的室裏發現數百塑像，這兩身天部像是其中破損最輕的兩件。斯坦因把同一遺迹的大致相同的這些泥像都斷爲8世紀。那是因爲離像不遠的地方發現了大曆（766～779年）和建中（780～783年）的貨幣（參照《西域》卷3，1194頁）。而在大英博物館的展品說明中，把它們的年代往後推至8～10世紀。如果沒有貨幣，斯坦因大概還會認爲這些像的年代更早，貨幣成了決定性的作用。有關這些像延襲了早期表現風格這點，數百年延續使用下來的模型的發現，可作充分說明。</p><p>正如圖95所示，明屋遺址以及許多寺院群無疑在回鶻時期仍然使用，根據壁畫上供養人的衣裳就能一目了然。但壁畫作爲該佛寺的主要裝飾而存在，顯示了由泥塑造像向壁畫图樣的轉變。因爲把兩者融洽地組合，是件不容易的事情。另外，貨幣遺物可能是塑造泥像沒遭破壞寺院仍然運轉時信徒們捐獻的香資。特別是屋脊沒有損壞而完整保留下來的寺中，即使倒塌了但沒有失火，塑像直到現在還完全保留著色彩。綜合以上考慮，這些像的年代，以風格極接近犍陀羅美術作爲最主要根據來判斷更合適。時代越往後，越能見到中國的影響，如圖102的菩薩頭部等及若干寺院的泥像。</p><p>結構上，其實由衆多像構成以及它們的組成方式（奧登堡在遺迹現場拍攝的若干圖的照片已收錄於他1914年的報告裏）等方面，這些明屋遺迹的身雕裝飾可與犍陀羅身雕裝飾進行比較。圖96中展示了具備那幾處特點的天部像。連細部都廣泛使用模子，産生出光滑有規則的表現。再者，天衣和裝飾物等粘貼的裝飾也用模子。此像膝蓋以下已缺損，但從Fig. 140我們可以推測出此像的比例。</p><p>這些像是在捆緊的槁草芯上反復塗上塑土，其上再安裝用模子製作的外形造型。經過火災，槁草的芯燃盡，只剩形狀和捆綁的繩子痕迹，色彩也比當初有變化，但經過燃燒塑土變得很堅硬，耐保存。披在兩肩上的天衣，像畫框一樣圍著塑像，遮蓋了鄰像和牆壁間的接合部。姿勢和表情的變化，可能是從模子裏取出以後，在半乾狀態下調整的，從圖104～109中展示的若干小像頭部可以窺出其究竟。</p><p>斯坦因的收集品中，包括很多實際製作這些像細部使用的模子，有一個小佛坐像的模子（Mi.iv.001）、兩個卷髮的模子、兩個穗狀頭髮的模子（參照《西域》，卷4，圖版CXXXVII）等。另外，奧登堡在庫車收集到的遺物中，有製作大型像上半身和頭部使用的大模子，現陳列于艾爾米塔什美術館。格倫威德爾和勒柯克在明屋發現的模子也有30多個（參照“Grunwedel”， 1912，192頁）。在巴黎的石膏模子與現在所談的斯坦因收集品中的模子相同。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 98-1"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.1061</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Figure of a warrior</title><title lang="chi-Hant">武士塑像</title><note lang="eng"><p>6th- 7th century A.D.</p><p>From Ming-oi</p><p>Painted stucco</p><p>H.42.8 cm</p><p>British Museum,MAS 1061 (figure: Mi. xii. 0010),MAS 1065 (shield: MI. xii. 0015; spear: Mi. xii. 0017)</p><p>See also Fig. 120</p><p>The occurrence of more or less identical figures through the use of moulds has enabled this figurine of a warrior in armour to be shown complete with spear and shield, although the three components were found separately in the same shrine at Ming-oi, in the passage (xii) behind the cella (xi). The decoration of the whole shrine consisted mainly of relief friezes along the walls. Stein recovered hundreds of fragments, but owing to damage by fire few had retained the original colouring as this example has.</p><p>The friezes of relief figures had been fixed to the walls on a wooden framework, square holes for which are clearly seen in one of Stein’s photographs (Serindia, Vol. Ⅲ, Fig. 291). The holes were in rows, the lowest about sixty centimetres from the ground and the next one and a half metres higher. At one point a projecting, cornice still remained, made of stucco over a wood and reed wattle framework, with rows of holes left by the small pegs which had fastened the figures to it. They had included a striking proportion of warrior figures such as this one. Perhaps they originally represented soldiers of the army of Mara. Their appearance and accoutrements have been excellently described by Stein in his entry for one of the figures (Mi. xi 00109); Serindia, Vol. Ⅲ, p. 1209). From this we learn the full extent of the colouring. The highly arched eyebrows, drawn down and in at their inner corners to make vertical furrows in the forehead and giving a fierce expression, were originally black, as were the protruding eyeballs, and the small moustache and imperial. The lips were crimson, and the face was coloured red, with a good deal of ochre.</p><p>The helmet is close-fitting, made up of leather scales and with a boss to receive a crest and a central projecting piece to protect the forehead between the eyebrows. The temples are protected by check pieces, and a gorget fits closely around the chin and protects the neck and upper chest. According to Stein, the whole helmet was painted in one colour, either red or green. Some of these features are very clearly seen in Mi. xii. 009 (Fig. 137), where the gorget was painted green.</p><p>On his body, the warrior wears a long tunic of scale-armour, with a heavy rolled collar, belted with a double cord in red and divided below the waist. The scales, which might be of iron rather than lacquered leather, are arranged in double rows, red, green or gilded. He carries a spear and a circular shield evidently of leather, with five bosses. A similar warrior, but with armour definitely composed of leather scales rounded at the top as seen in some of the Stein lacquered scales (Pl. 49), was found at Ming-oi by Huang Wenbi and is illustrated by him (Huang Wenbi, 1958, Pl. 42).</p><p>Many elements, from the projection on he helmet to the single long suit of the main armour, recall Sasanian or Iranian examples. The type appears to have been widespread across Central Asia: similar coats with wide lapels are worn by the aristocratic donors of some of the wall paintings in Buddhist shrines near Kizil. In the Hermitage Museum, Leningrad, are a number of important finds brought from Kucha by Oldenburg. They include both soldiers from Mara’s army, preserved with their colouring largely intact, and a large intact mould for making similar figures. These all have plain tunics rather than scale-armour, but the forms of the rolled collar with its lapels, and of the helmets and gorgets, are the same. Their bright polychrome colouring allows us to imagine the art of the shrines at Ming-oi as it originally appeared and in relation both to the wall paintings of Kizil to the west, and to the later figures found by Kozlov at Karakhoto farther east and now also in the Hermitage Museum.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>6～7世紀</p><p>焉耆（明屋）出土</p><p>彩塑</p><p>高42.8釐米</p><p>大英博物館,MAS1061（武士像：Mi.xii.0010）,MAS1065（盾：Mi.xii.0015；槍：Mi.xii.0017）</p><p>參見Fig. 120</p><p>由於是用模子製作的像外觀幾乎相同，因此本圖展示的身著鎧甲的武士與槍和盾可以作爲完整的圖像來展示，儘管武士、盾和槍分別從明屋遺迹同一寺址的通路(xii)和小室背後(xi)等不同場所發現的。那個寺址的內部裝飾，是以壁面上加半雕的帶狀裝飾爲主。斯坦因發現的大量這種斷片，由於火災的破壞，如本圖的像一樣保持住原來色彩的極爲罕見。</p><p>一連串的半雕像用木釘安裝在牆壁上，在斯坦因所攝的照片中，可見到残留的方洞（參照《西域》第3卷，Fig. 291）。洞是成行排列的，最下邊的離地面60釐米，上邊的約在150釐米處。用木和槁草編織的框架上，泥作突出的壁楣現只剩一處，洞中仍留著固定塑像的小木釘。一連串的半雕像中，有幾个如本圖这样的優美匀称的武士像，它們大概是魔王的士兵。有關其外觀和裝扮，斯坦因就收集品中的一件做了精闢的介紹（參照《西域》第3卷1209頁，Mi.xi.00109的解說）。細看本圖的像可以發現整個像都上了彩。如當初眉用墨描出很彎的弧形，眉間加了縱皺，産生出勇猛形象。另外，突出的眼球和小髭鬍等也用墨描，唇是紅色、臉上塗了赤和黃褐色。</p><p>看似革製的兜鍪戴在頭上正合適，頂部有兜飾的座，前面可见突出保護眉間的片。而太陽穴被兩側垂下的部分護着，脖子和前胸上部恰好緊緊包在颚圍中得到保護。據斯坦因講，整个兜鍪都上過赤或綠的色彩。上述的若干特徵，在其他Mi. xii. 009武士的頭部（Fig. 137）也可清楚看到，那武士的喉部上塗了綠色。</p><p>本圖的武士著大卷領長裾鱗鎧甲，腰系兩條紅色腰帶，鎧甲從腰以下分叉。鎧甲的鱗片可能不是塗漆的革，是鐵的，紅、綠、金色交替配出兩列。武士持著槍和圓形盾，盾明顯是革製的，有五個浮凸飾。黃文弼從明屋遺迹發現有同樣的武士像，刊載在他的著作（《塔里木盆地考古记》北京，1958年，圖版42）中，但鎧甲與斯坦因發現的若干塗漆鱗片（參照彩色圖版第49圖）相同，上端是圓形，明顯是革製的鱗片。</p><p>從兜鍪頂部的突起到長單衣的鎧甲，其風格使人想起薩珊王朝波斯或伊朗的因素。大概此風格曾在中亞廣泛流傳，在克孜爾近郊的佛寺壁畫上也見到有穿相同寬折領大衣的貴族供養人像。另外，聖彼得堡艾爾米塔什美術館收藏的奧登堡從庫車發掘的的大量珍貴文物中，有色彩保留非常好的魔王士兵們，以及兩塊模子。不僅是鎧甲，那些簡單的長襟外衣，翻領的卷邊，以及兜鍪和護喉具的風格等都一樣。那些鮮豔多彩的顔色，不僅與西方的克孜爾壁畫有關，還出現在明屋的美術品中，在時代稍晚，科茲洛夫發現於遙遠的東方黑水城現藏於艾爾米塔什美術館的諸像，也受到波及和影響。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 98-2"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.1065</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Figure of a warrior</title><title lang="chi-Hant">武士塑像</title><note lang="eng"><p>6th- 7th century A.D.</p><p>From Ming-oi</p><p>Painted stucco</p><p>H.42.8 cm</p><p>British Museum,MAS 1061 (figure: Mi. xii. 0010),MAS 1065 (shield: MI. xii. 0015; spear: Mi. xii. 0017)</p><p>See also Fig. 120</p><p>The occurrence of more or less identical figures through the use of moulds has enabled this figurine of a warrior in armour to be shown complete with spear and shield, although the three components were found separately in the same shrine at Ming-oi, in the passage (xii) behind the cella (xi).

The warrior of Pl. 98 came from the chamber (xii) immediately behind, but other similar warrior figures were found in the cella itself. Examples of other figures, the majority of them found in the same shrine, are seen in Figs. 123-44. Among them are many that clearly show how moulds were employed for the basic face, while variations in the headdress were added, often making further use of moulded elements (compare Pl. 100 with the female heads seen in Figs. 126-29).</p><p>In addition to these lightly clad figures of worshipping devatas, the same cella also contained figures of a different kind: female figures whose covering draperies are indicated with deeply incised lines (Fig. 141), and representations of emaciated male figures, wearing the same crossed pearled bands with lotus medallion and framed by the same kind of background shawl (Fig. 142), but with muscles and tendons powerfully modelled to accentuate their privations, in strong contrast to the soft and tender forms of the female figures.</p><p>All of these figures, built upon reed cores, were originally coloured. Those few traces that remained are described in Serindia (Vol. Ⅲ, p. 1205): the flesh tint was light red; the hair blue or red, with red jewels and a gilt fillet binding it; and the eyes blue over white. Although few traces remained, and none at all of the drapery colours, the description alone is enough to suggest a close relation-ship with the vividly preserved art of Kucha and Kizil. Fortunately, far more of the colouring, including the drapery colours, is preserved in the clay statues taken by Le Coq from the cave temples at Shorchuk, close to the ruined shrines of Ming-oi that stood out in the open (Along the Ancient Silk Routes, Nos. 65-78).</p><p>Other similar figures are seen with the upper body preserved, as in Pl. 99, in Fig. 124, and with a slender form and long legs in Figs. 139 and 140. These examples show how the upper body was generally nude, the legs lightly draped. The pearl border is seen repeatedly, in the necklace and bands crossing the chest, as well as around the medallions on the upper arms and where the bands cross. One of the clearest examples (Stein considered it the best of the relief figures found in the cella) is seen in Pl. 96.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>6～7世紀</p><p>焉耆（明屋）出土</p><p>泥塑</p><p>高10.5釐米</p><p>大英博物館,MAS1021（Mi.xi.0061）</p><p>無論是第99圖的半身像，還是第100圖的頭部，均與圖96、97中所見的天部像一起，均來自明屋内殿（xi）三層的中楣。圖98展示的武士像是從裏側的房間（xii）發現的，從内殿（xi）也發現了幾個同樣的武士像。另外，從該寺址還發現了大量其他像，見於Figs. 123-44。它們之中，可以看出臉部的基本造型大多使用了模子，並添加了用另一模子製作的裝飾，使頭飾有了變化（對圖100的頭部和Figs. 126-29的頭部等進行比較）。</p><p>除了發現此種著薄衣的供養天部外，在同一内殿中還發現了下面所述的另一種類型的塑像：用深刻的紋理表現厚衣的女性像（參照Fig. 141）以及消瘦的男性像（(Fig. 142)等，男性像與本圖一樣兩肩披著連珠紋帶，在胸前交叉，交叉處有蓮花紋的圓形裝飾。背面是同樣的天衣的邊，但爲了表現苦行的樣子，強調了筋骨和腱，與女性像的柔和、親切姿態形成鮮明對比。</p><p>這些像都用蘆葦桿做芯，當時曾上過彩。有關保留下的僅有的彩色痕迹，在《西域》（參照第3卷，1205頁）中有詳細敍述：皮膚是淡紅色，頭髮爲青或紅色，頭髮上裝飾紅色寶石，紮金色帶。眼睛是在塗的白上加青色瞳。臉部色彩幾乎沒有保留，也完全辨別不出衣服的顔色。僅根據敍述也能充分看出，這些像與庫車或克孜爾現在仍很鮮豔的美術作品有密切關係。幸運的是，在勒柯克收集的塑像中，能夠見到包括衣物在內，所有色彩都保留極好的像。據說他是在離明屋遺迹非常近的碩爾楚克石窟收集到的（參照《沿著古代絲路》，65～78圖）。</p><p>與圖99同類的像，上半身在Fig. 124中，細長的軀幹和腿部則展示在Figs. 139 和140中。綜合這些範例，大致是上半身裸露，腿上裹薄衣。連珠紋被反復使用於首飾、胸前交叉的帶子、兩臂及帶子交叉點上的圓形裝飾周圍等處。各部分都保存得最好（斯坦因從此内殿發現的浮雕像中，這是最好的作品）是圖96中的像。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 101"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.1082</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Head of a Bodhisattva</title><title lang="chi-Hant">菩薩頭部塑像</title><note lang="eng"><p>7th- 8th century A.D.</p><p>From Ming-oi</p><p>Stucco</p><p>H.20.5 cm</p><p>British Museum,MAS 1082 (Mi. xv. 0010)</p><p>See also Fig. 130.</p><p>Shrine xv of the Ming-oi shrines was “a plain cella about 12 feet square” and, like the other shrines, had suffered damage by fire; but in it Stein discovered both some fine pieces of wood carving (Pls. 114-15) and, among other examples of stucco reliefs, this large and beautiful Bodhisattva head.

The image base, still intact and showing some of the identical decoration as the other half, can be seen in two of Stein’s photographs of the ruined shrine (Serindia, Vol.Ⅲ, Figs. 289-90). Next to the pedestal is another life-size seated Bodhisattva on a lotus seat, with a large part of the man-dorla still intact. The Bodhisattva’s head is missing, and Stein was unable to remove the figure because of its weight. In his description, however, he mentioned the richly embroidered garments with floral designs, recalling the workmanship of Chinese figured silks. In the antechapel there was still a fragment of a wall painting (Mi. xviii. 004; Serindia, Vol. Ⅳ, Pl. CXXVI), with Uighur donors and inscriptions below and part of a scene showing the bare legs of a man knee-deep in a pool, accompanied by a dragon. From this fragment of a wall painting, as well as from the style of the large fragments of stucco figures, it is possible to contrast eighth- and ninth-century Ming-oi art with the earlier reliefs found in such abundance by Stein and others at the site.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，8～9世紀</p><p>焉耆（明屋）出土</p><p>彩塑</p><p>高30.0釐米</p><p>大英博物館,MAS1102（Mi.xviii.0010）</p><p>此大型菩薩頭部與上兩圖的天部、菩薩頭部及圖103的大型佛頭有許多不同的特點。不僅色彩保留較好，形態和風格也完全不同。面部輪廓爲方形，膚色稍顯厚重，反映了很深的中國影響。最爲引人注目的是眼睛的表現，半睜的眼瞼有微妙的曲線。三山冠下的頭髮中分，稍作重疊，梳向後面。此髮型多見於菩薩頭部，遠離了用彩帶纏繞髮髻的古典模式。</p><p>在同一寺址（xviii）還發現了著鎧甲、肩托兇猛怪物頭，大概是天王像的單臂（Fig. 145），以及壺、莨苕葉淺浮雕的半圓形台座――實際上是圓形台的前半部分（Fig. 156），正紅、栗色、青色等當時鮮豔的色彩幾乎是原封不動地保留在菩薩坐像的彎膝部分（Fig. 157）等。斯坦因拍攝的此廢寺的兩張照片，可見到此室對面，相同裝飾的壇基完整的面貌（參照《西域》第3卷，Figs. 289-90）。連接那台座的有另一與真人等身的菩薩像，其坐在蓮華座上，曼陀羅的大部分還完整地保留著。菩薩的頭部雖已殘失，但仍很重，斯坦因無法移動。根據斯坦因的記錄，此像的穿著讓人想起中國織錦技術的華麗花紋的刺繡外衣。其前室裏還殘留著壁畫斷片（參照Mi.xviii.004,《西域》第4卷，圖版CXXVI）。此壁畫的下段有回鶻供養人像和回鶻文題記，上段有水淹及男子赤裸的膝蓋以下及身旁的龍。根據此壁畫斷片以及塑像殘片的風格，可以嘗試對8～9世紀的明屋美術和斯坦因及其他人從此遺迹發現的更早時期的大量浮雕類作品進行比較研究。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 103"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.1094</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Head of a Buddha</title><title lang="chi-Hant">佛頭雕塑</title><note lang="eng"><p>6th- 7th century A.D.</p><p>From Ming-oi</p><p>Stucco</p><p>H.22.8 cm</p><p>MAS 1094 (Mi. xvii. 003)</p><p>This well-moulded head, almost life-size and with sharply defined features, was one of a number (see also Fig. 134) found in a shrine slightly apart from the rest and raised on a high-walled terrace, whose brickwork was strengthened with layers of reeds. The interior of the shrine was completely filled with hard-burned debris, and Stein only had time to effect a partial clearance around the entrance. No trace was found of the bodies belonging to this or to other similar heads, all close in style to those found in nearby ruins (x-xii). Stein’s explanation was that the bodies were insufficiently fired in the conflagration that destroyed the temple, but another observation should perhaps be made here. Although reports from other sites (cf. Toumchouq, 1964, Vol. Ⅱ, p. 142) confirm that the material used was generally clay mixed with some fibre, it seems probable that the heads, moulded and fashioned separately, could have been hardened in the open, before being fitted to the bodies which, being necessarily modelled in situ, remained softer and more vulnerable. This might account for the preservation of so many finely detailed heads. As noted in the description of the tile seen in Pl. 112, Stein himself ventured the possibility of an actual firing of some pieces, besides the hardening and loss of colour during the destruction of the shrines.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>6～7世紀</p><p>焉耆（明屋）出土</p><p>泥塑</p><p>高22.8釐米</p><p>MAS1094（Mi.xvii.003）</p><p>此用模子製造精良，極具特徵，約等同真人大的佛頭，是從距其他寺址較遠，用槁草加固磚堆的高臺地上的一個殿堂中發現的大量遺物中的一件（Fig.134圖）。殿堂的內部被燒成的硬物掩埋，斯坦因爲清理入口附近不得不花費相當長的時間。包括此佛頭在內，本址發現的几个頭像，在風格上與鄰近的x～xii遺迹發現的遺物極接近，而有關這些頭部的身軀，則毫無線索。斯坦因認爲，軀體毀於寺院這場大火，關於此事也許還需要另外的考察。在有關另一遺迹的考察報告（參照《Toumchouq》1964年，第2卷142頁）中，確認在泥土裏通常摻雜纖維。推測頭部與身軀是分別用模子製作，臉部在整理安裝在身軀上之前，在戶外被曬乾變硬。與此相比，軀體則必須在原位置上製作，堅固性差，處在容易損壞的狀態。從這種情況考慮，非常多的保持住精美細部的頭部被保留了下來，是說得通的。如圖112的磚的解說中提到的，斯坦因對許多作品都做過嘗試性的論述，由於佛堂的火災而變得堅固及色彩喪失之前，作品某些部件要進行燒煉。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 104"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.1041</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Heads of male figures</title><title lang="chi-Hant">男性天部頭像</title><note lang="eng"><p>6th- 7th century A.D.</p><p>From Ming-oi</p><p>Stucco</p><p>H.11.7 cm, 11.5 cm, 14.0 cm, 10.5 cm</p><p>MAS 1041 (Mi. xi. 00123), MAS 1036 (Mi. xi. 00101),</p><p>MAS 1037 (Mi. xi. 00102), MAS 1059 (Mi. xii. 005)</p><p>These heads, three from the ruined cella, xi, and the fourth from the chamber behind, clearly show the use of moulding and modelling techniques.

One end of the robe falls over the hands and down to touch the lotus seat, in a fashion similar to an ascetic figure of the Buddha in Cave 248 at Dunhuang, of Northern Wei date (Chugoku Sekkutsu, Tonko Makkokutsu, Vol. 1, Pl. 80). Given this resemblance and the proportions of the figure, a date much later than the sixth century A.D. seems unlikely. At Shrine iv, beyond the detached cella where this plaque was discovered, Stein found a plaster mould for a pair of curls for a beard, a pair of zig-zag locks of hair, and a small seated Buddha, the face left without details so as to be finished after moulding. Such a mould, which could be used to produce both small details of a large figure and a single complete Buddha plaque of very small size, shows how the decoration of the Ming-oi shrines at Shorchuk was conceived as a whole: probably small seated figures of the Buddha, like those found at Dandan-oilik and Rawak (cf. Pls. 61-62, 65, 73), were set in the nimbus or vesica of the larger images. If so, then this figure is an especially fine example of its kind.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>6～7世紀</p><p>焉耆（明屋）出土</p><p>彩塑</p><p>高15.0釐米</p><p>MAS1111（Mi.xxiv.001）</p><p>以美麗的高浮雕體現的此像，從兩側到軀幹的線收成反向三角形狀，顯出纖細的體態，衣服的一頭利索地蓋住雙手後，又懸垂到下面的蓮華座上。這種風格與敦煌第248窟北魏時期的釋迦苦行像（參照《中國石窟 敦煌莫高窟》第1卷圖80）非常相似，從此像的比例看，可認爲其時代距6世紀不太遠。此像是從iv寺址的那個獨立内殿的深處發現的，斯坦因還在那裏發現了很多石膏模子：一對鬍鬚的捲曲部分，一對鋸齒狀的卷毛、小佛坐像等的模子。小佛的模子沒有表現臉的細部，可知道是造完型後再進行細部加工的。這種模子既用於製作大型佛像的局部，也用於製作完整的小像。因此通過它們，可窺見有關肖爾楚克明屋寺院內部裝飾之全貌：小佛坐像可能與丹丹烏里克及熱瓦克發現的遺物（參照圖61、62、65、73）相同，曾安裝在大佛像背光上。如果是那樣，此像則可以說是同類作品中特別出色的作品。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 111"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.1092</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Head of a Bodhisattva</title><title lang="chi-Hant">菩薩頭部</title><note lang="eng"><p>6th- 7th century A.D.</p><p>From Ming-oi</p><p>Fragment of moulded tile</p><p>H. 16.4 cm, W. 14.3 cm</p><p>MAS 1092 (Mi. xvi. 001)</p><p>This fine head represents a different aspect of the decoration of the temples at the Ming-oi site.

The present example is one of seventeen fragments found by Stein in a small recess (xvi) next to the cella (xv). Its walls were bright red as if it had been used as a kiln, and the tiles were found thrown together in a heap, though here too there were signs of a subsequent accidental burning.

The back of the tile is roughly smoothed, but there are signs of its having been attached to the wall with a thin pad of clay. Stein thought that the tile had been separately fired before use, as well as undergoing an accidental firing when the site was destroyed.</p><p>The subject is a splendid Bodhisattva head, set in a roundel with a large pearl border. The hair is bound with a twisted fillet which has one pearled strand; above this the central feature is a five-petalled lotus with a pearl border. The whole tile was moulded in one piece, but some details such as the small side-locks and the ear ornaments (smaller pearled roundels) were separately moulded and applied. The spandrels are filled with scrolling motifs.</p><p>The style of the face and hair, like that of many of the stucco figures from Ming-oi and that of the moulds found by Oldenburg and Le Coq, is not far removed from the art of Gandhara. The threefold use of the pearl border (in the ear ornaments, the lotus headpiece, and around the whole head) is a valuable guide to the date. By the Sui dynasty, in the late sixth century, usage of pearl borders had reached Dunhuang and was well established, in both borders and garment patterns (cf. Cave 420; Chugoku Sekkutsu, Tonko Makkokutsu, Vol. 2, Pl. 62). Thus, there can be little doubt that the mould used for this tile was made in the sixth century, and the tile itself is probably not much later in date.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>6～7世紀</p><p>焉耆（明屋）出土</p><p>模製泥磚</p><p>高22.5釐米 寬23.6釐米</p><p>MAS1108(Mi.xxiii.1)</p><p>此精致的磚，完全保留著和前圖中展示的斷片基本相同的設計。背面是粗糙的平板，可看到把它安裝在牆壁上時所用的粘土痕迹。斯坦因認爲，此磚不僅遭受过遺迹被破壞時的意外火災，還在使用前燒煉過。</p><p>用大聯珠紋圈起來的圓盤中央配有華麗的菩薩頭部，其頭髮用有聯珠紋的帶子紮起。另外，上面頭飾中央的五瓣蓮華飾的周圍，也圈著聯珠紋。整個磚是用一個模子作的，而兩側小的穗狀毛髮和耳飾（用聯珠紋圈起的小圓盤）等，是單獨製作後安裝上的。三角拱肩被旋渦形的裝飾填充。</p><p>臉和頭髮的樣子，與奧登堡和勒柯克發現的模子以及從明屋帶回的大多泥像相同，與犍陀羅美術無太大差距。使用三層聯珠紋（耳飾、頭飾、圍頭部整體的圓形）這一點，是斷定年代的重要線索。聯珠紋是隋代以前，直到6世紀末，在敦煌流傳，定格在邊飾和衣紋的花飾這兩項上（參照420窟，《中國石窟 敦煌莫高窟》第2卷圖62）。因此，首先認爲此磚的模子無疑是6世紀時製作的，另外，磚本身的年代也不會太晚。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 113"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.1069</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Camel</title><title lang="chi-Hant">駱駝</title><note lang="eng"><p>6th- 7th century A.D.</p><p>From Ming-oi</p><p>Painted stucco</p><p>L. 31.0 cm (40.0 cm to end of reed bundle)</p><p>MAS 1069 (Mi. xii. 0025)</p><p>This finely modeled figure of the head and neck of a camel is from the same passage (xii) behind the cella (xi) from which, as we have seen, other pieces survived untouched by fire and with some of their original colouring intact (cf.

The two wooden pieces had somehow survived the fire that had hardened and preserved the latter.</p><p>As Stein recognized upon finding the statuette, the Lokapala’s dress recalls that of the Lokapalas found among the Chinese paintings at Dunhuang (Vol. 1,Pls. 60-66), and the whole figure is certainly of Chinese workmanship. The various items of dress worn by such figures have been well described in Serindia (Vol. Ⅱ, p. 940), but there are certain differences worth describing here.</p><p>Usually the Lokapalas, or Guardian Kings, wear a coat of mail and a breastplate; here the coat, reaching from the shoulders and upper arms to just above the knees, is similar in length but has no indication of leather scales. The lower edge of this coat falls to a sweeping point between the legs and is hitched up to leave the knees free, exactly as seen in the paintings. A mantle covers the entire back of the figure, carved with a few simple folds, and is knotted across the chest beneath the chin. In the paintings (Vol. 1, Pls. 64-65) this mantle is black. In addition to the mantle, the statuette, like the paintings, has a stole, knotted in places, which hangs from the arms. (The hands and lower forearms, like the feet, are lost but can be seen to have been bent at the elbows like the joined hands of the Lokapala seen in Vol. 1, Pl. 60.) The girdle around the waist is of twisted drapery (some of the painted examples have a decorated leather belt), and a second flat girdle is wound twice around the chest, with the two ends tucked in and hanging from it. Enough remains of the legs to show that the figure wore leg coverings and greaves, the latter apparently of leather in shaped panels.</p><p>The statuette was originally painted, and a few traces of black paint still-remaining are noted in the description in Serindia. Part of the head and proper right shoulder are missing and show charring from the fire that consumed the temple. It is easy to imagine that there were originally many more wooden figures that did not survive.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，8世紀</p><p>焉耆（明屋）出土</p><p>木雕</p><p>高25.6釐米</p><p>MAS1091（Mi.xv.0031）</p><p>此作工非常出色的小像和下圖展示的木雕鍍金背光，是從出土圖101中展示的大型菩薩頭的同一内殿發現的。儘管兩者都是木雕，卻竟然能逃脫了將菩薩佛頭燒硬的火災，保留至今。</p><p>斯坦因發現此小像，在看其衣著時，想起敦煌發現的絹繪天王像（參照第1卷圖61～66）的衣著，此像的確是通過中國人之手製造的。有關敦煌畫中天王像穿著的各種衣裝，在《西域》（參照第2卷940頁）中有詳細說明，在此主要對它們明顯的不同點加以敍述。</p><p>天王像通常著鎧甲和胸甲，而此像則從兩肩、上臂到膝的正上方，是基本與它們等長的上衣，見不到鎧甲的革制鱗片。</p><p>此像上衣的下端，與繪畫中所見的情況相同，下垂到兩腿間後擡起，使膝蓋能自由活動。刻著數條單純褶線的披風，恰好裹住像的整個背面垂下，正面可見胸前和顎下的繫結。繪畫（第1卷圖64、65）中，這種外套被繪成黑色。除了披風，與繪畫間有共同點的例子，還可舉出幾處繫結和從兩臂垂落的天衣（兩手、前臂、腳等已缺損，但在第1卷圖60中可見到天王像手合掌的樣子，天衣從肘部折曲垂下）。軀幹上纏著布擰的腰帶（繪畫中多是皮革腰帶）。胸圍上纏兩圈與此不同的平帶，兩端塞在裏邊垂下來。從兩腿的殘存部，可窺見此像帶著護腿和脛甲。脛甲表現的似乎是模壓的皮革製品。</p><p>這小像原曾上過彩，《西域》中記錄有黑顔料的痕迹。頭的一部分和右肩已殘缺，還可見此寺被燒毀時，火災燒焦的痕迹。不難想象原來曾存在過很多木雕像。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 115"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.1090</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Part of a vesica</title><title lang="chi-Hant">佛坐像背光斷片</title><note lang="eng"><p>6th- 7th century A.D.</p><p>From Ming-oi</p><p>Carved and gilt wood</p><p>H. 51.3 cm, W. 12.2 cm</p><p>MAS 1090 (Mi. xv. 0029)</p><p>This well-preserved segment of the vesica surrounding a large figure was found in the same cella as the Lokapala of the preceding plate. The piece has a tenon at one end and a mortice at the other, and the inner edge is rebated to fit the background of the figure. The gilding is applied over a white ground after carving.</p><p>A series of five meditating Buddhas is carved in the piece. All have a nimbus and a mandorla, but the three on the right, which are seated upright, also have pointed flames to fill the spaces above them. At the point where the curvature decreases, the arrangement changes and the Buddhas are aligned perpendicular to the edges. Thus, even though only this single piece has survived, we can easily reconstruct the appearance of the complete vesica arch, or at least its upper part, as having been in three segments, of which the top one would have been much straighter than the two side pieces.</p><p>Such carved wooden surrounds for Buddhist images have parallels at sites besides the Ming-oi shrines near Karashahr. The closest examples, also carved and gilded, are in the Pelliot collection at the Musée Guimet, from the sites at Subashi and Duldur-akhur, near Kucha (Mission Paul Pelliot IV, Figs. L39, L41). Another piece comes from the Great Nirvana Cave at Kizil (Bhattacharya, 1977, Fig. 35). These similar pieces, which are close in details such as the flowers used to fill spaces between the successive Buddha figures (compare Pl. 115-2 and the piece from Duldur-akhur, L41), help to confirm the relatively early date of much of the art of the Ming-oi shrines.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>6～7世紀</p><p>焉耆（明屋）出土</p><p>高51.3釐米 寬12.釐米</p><p>木雕鍍金</p><p>MAS1090（Mi.xv.0029）</p><p>此保存狀態良好的弓形木雕斷片，是環繞大型佛像周圍的背光的一部分，是和圖114天王像在同一内殿發現的。一端有榫，另一端有榫眼。另外，內側邊緣仍殘留將其拼接在佛像背光時所用的牙子痕迹。雕刻完成後塗白，再鍍金。</p><p>此斷片上，雕刻著五身定印佛坐像，全有頭光和身光。右側三身的身體垂直，背後被尖頭的火焰光遮住。佛像在上方曲線變成緩坡的地方改了方向，儘量使佛像面向曲線軸中心。因此，雖然此斷片只留下一段，但能完全復原整個背光。至少可以說，如果上方是並排著三身的話，最上面的一身比起兩側的兩身，尺寸會略縮小些。</p><p>佛像背後採用這種木雕的背光，不僅在焉耆近郊的明屋，其他遺迹中也曾發現過。鍍金木雕中，與此最相似的，可舉出伯希和從庫車近郊的蘇巴什和Duldur-akhur獲得，現存於集美美術館的作品（參照伯希和考察團第IV卷，Fig.L39，L41）。另外，還有從克孜爾大涅槃洞攜走的作品（Bhattacharya, 1977, Fig. 35）。它們的相似程度，竟然到了小佛和小佛間的空間，都是用花來填充的細部表現上（參照圖115－2，以及Duldur-akhur出土的L41）。這也爲判斷明屋遺迹的美術品大多是較早時期的，提供了線索。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 116"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.1079</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Part of a miniature reliquary</title><title lang="chi-Hant">&gt;舍利容器斷片</title><note lang="eng"><p>5th -6th century A.D.</p><p>From Ming-oi</p><p>Painted wood</p><p>H. 12.0 cm, W. 6.8 cm</p><p>MAS 1079 (Mi. xiv. 003)</p><p>This small but handsome piece is a short curved section from a cylindrical wooden reliquary about 20 cm in diameter.

One, found by Le Coq at Gaochang (Le Coq, 1913, Pl. 57c; Along the Ancient Silk Routes, No. 105), still has the hinges that attached it to the back panel. It represents a single seated figure of Ksitigarbha holding a cintamani, and one can imagine that the whole shrine, when open, formed a triptych with a central Buddha flanked by Ksitigarbha on the left and another Bodhisattva, probably Avalokitesvara, on the right. Traces of polychrome decoration can still be seen on close examination. When closed, the three parts of the shrine would have formed a cylinder tapering smoothly to a point.</p><p>The shrine shown here is also the left-hand leaf of such a triptych, but it is considerably earlier than the Le Coq shrine (dated to the ninth century A.D.). Its earlier date is reflected in the subject matter as well as in style and arrangement. The cult of Ksitigarbha was a fairly late development of Mahayana Buddhism, but the scenes shown here are still very much concerned with Hinayana, the Lesser Vehicle. They are arranged in three registers. At the top is a standing Buddha with an attendant holding a parasol. The middle scene is the most important: on the left is a standing Buddha on a lotus flower, his hands in the same gesture of abhaya-mudra as the Buddha above; on the right, two kneeling figures are in attitudes of adoration, and a third figure is kneeling and is bent forward so that his head is touching the ground beneath the Buddha’s feet. The lowest register is divided into two small panels reflecting the quadrant shape of the leaf: on the left is a standing Buddha with staff, and on the right, where they would remain hidden unless the shrine were fully opened, are two kneeling male donors.</p><p>It is middle scene that can be identified, as the jataka of Sumati. The Buddha’s career as a Bodhisattva began when, as a Brahman student with a water pot, he worshipped the Buddha by scattering lotuses he had obtained from a young woman in exchange for a promise of marriage in their future lives; then, spreading his hair beneath Dipankara’s feet, he vowed to be a Buddha himself. Dipankara promised fulfillment of the vow and the kneeling youth rose into the air in a circle of light. The scene here, when compared with Gandharan versions in stone (cf. Foucher, 1905,Vol. 1, pp. 273-79), appears considerably simplified: the young man is seen spreading his hair on the ground, but neither acquiring flowers or scattering them.</p><p>Since the young woman who kneels behind the prostrate figure does not bear flowers, we cannot know if she is his future wife, Yasodhara, or merely one of the adoring figures also found in the Gandharan reliefs. Nor can we be sure if the other kneeling figure is another such figure, or the Bodhisattva a after rising into the air. In the top scene, the Buddha attended by a servant with a parasol is not identifiable, but might be Dipankara, on the point of entering the city of Dipavati where this event took place.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>5～6世紀</p><p>可攜帶寺院的一葉</p><p>焉耆（明屋）出土</p><p>彩色木雕</p><p>高28.2釐米</p><p>MAS1000（Mi.ix.001）</p><p>可隨身攜帶的木製佛龕，在中亞罕有發現，但每一個的特點都很有意思。其中勒柯克從高昌發現的一件（參照勒柯克《高昌》1913，圖57c; Along the Ancient Silk Routes, No. 105），其佛龕背板上還留著合頁，上面是一身手持寶珠的地藏菩薩坐像。原來，它在打開時，是以佛爲中心，左邊的是地藏菩薩，右邊的大概是觀世音菩薩的另一菩薩，採用的是三個面連接的形式，關閉時，三個部分可合成圓筒形，上部是細尖狀。</p><p>這裏展示的佛龕，也是那種三面中的左側部分，但是可能要比勒柯克的要早（勒柯克的佛龕屬9世紀）。這不僅從風格和排列上，地藏菩薩信仰也是在大乘佛教相當晚的時期才開始盛行，這裏見到的情景，還殘留著濃厚的與小乘佛教有關的色彩。場面被分割成三段，上段是攜帶持華蓋侍者的立佛。中段最重要：左側的蓮華座上面，與上段的佛一樣結施無畏印而立，右側是合掌的兩身跪像，其前方是伏在地上，頭幾乎觸到佛腳的像。最下段被隔開成兩個小區，使人想到四分儀的形狀：左半部分有持杖的佛立像。右邊的部分，不把佛龕完全打開則無法充分看清，有兩身跪著的供養人像。</p><p>中段可以判斷爲善慧童子本生，佛在前世還曾是菩薩的時候，善慧童子作爲持水罐婆羅門的修業僧，向年輕婦人買花供佛，在燃燈佛腳下散髮立下成佛的誓願。比起犍陀羅石造雕刻（Foucher,，1905，第1卷273～279頁），這裏表現的情景相當簡單。表現了年輕人在地上散髮的場景，而沒有表現買花以及供奉的事情。</p><p>伏在地上的年輕人的正後方，沒有跪著手持花的年輕婦人，所以不清楚那婦人是不是他未來的妻子耶輪陀羅，或只是在犍陀羅浮雕中出現的一個崇拜者。另外，也不清楚其後方跪的另一身像也是相同的崇拜者，還是光之中站立的菩薩。對于上段的由持華蓋的侍者伴隨的佛也很難加以判斷，也許是燃燈佛進入此事發生的燈光城時的情景。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 118"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.983</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Carved and painted cornice</title><title lang="chi-Hant">木梁斷片</title><note lang="eng"><p>5th- 6th century A.D.</p><p>From Khora</p><p>Wood, painted and gilt</p><p>H. 31.0 cm, L. 53.5 cm</p><p>MAS 983 (Khora. IV. i. 002)</p><p>Although darkened and difficult to make out, the scenes shown on this fragment are of particular interest. It is the only item in the Stein Collection to show the Buddha preaching to disciples, in a style that is close to that of the wall paintings from Kizil.</p><p>This is a fragment of a wooden beam, most of the back of which has been pared away to reduce its thickness for transport. The top edge overhangs the painted scenes, and is decorated with cruciform florets of gold leaf. Below the scenes was a close-set row of grotesque lions, separately carved and dowelled to the main piece. Only two survive, having been recovered detached. With forepaws crossed in front of them, manes hanging either side, and a chevron band running down the chest, they have a most distinctive appearance, and match almost exactly two lions with heads turned from Tumshuk in the Pelliot collection (Musée Guimet, EO. 1350, 1351; Mission Paul Pelliot Ⅰ, Ⅱ, Toumchouq, Vol. I, Pl. 271-2).</p><p>In contrast, the painted scenes are extremely fine in execution, in rich colours and gold but very much darkened, so that Stein only reproduced the two lions in Serindia. Despite the darkening, the graceful forms of the seated Buddhas (one inclined to the right and the other to the left, and each surrounded by a crowd of divine worshippers) can easily be made out. The arrangement is almost identical to that of some of the wall paintings at Kizil, such as the two registers of preaching groups in Cave 17 and Cave 14. There too the preaching scenes are placed immediately below the projecting cornice from which springs the semicircular vault, and are divided by pearled borders, here done with small squares of gold leaf.</p><p>The Khora shrines were free-standing and not cut into a cliff as those at Kizil. Although the remains Stein recovered from these shrines are scanty (see Pl. 119), they are enough to show their early date and character as closely associated with the style prevalent in Kucha in the fifth and sixth centuries A.D., before the influence of China was strongly felt.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>5～6世紀</p><p>霍拉出土</p><p>彩繪、金箔木製</p><p>高31.0釐米 寬53.5釐米</p><p>MAS983(Khora.IV.i.002)</p><p>已經發黑，很難判別，但此斷片上表現的場面卻非常有意思。形式與克孜爾壁畫的說法圖很相似，表現佛給弟子說法場面的作品，在斯坦因收集品中只有這一件。</p><p>這是木梁的斷片，裏面大部分被削去，很薄，易於搬運。上端向前突出，有用金箔作成小花的十字紋裝飾。繪畫部分的下方，排列著單獨雕刻後用釘子固定上的怪異獅子。發現時，已經脫落，通過修復，現在保留下來兩隻。</p><p>兩旁垂下長長的鬃毛，胸毛用連續的山形紋表示，前肢交叉放在胸前。此獅子獨特的姿態，與伯希和從圖木舒克所獲的兩只頭向側面的獅子(參照集美美術館EO.1350、1351，伯希和調查團《圖木舒克》第1卷，圖版271－2)的表現大致相同。</p><p>與此相比，涂了金彩，用丰富的色彩精細描繪的繪畫，卻變得太黑，因此斯坦因除了两頭獅子外，其餘未刊載在《西域》中。然而，即使是變黑，但也能很容易分辨出（左和右边的身體略歪的具優美姿態的佛坐像，和圍繞他們的供養天部）。配置如克孜爾第17窟和第14窟的說法圖等克孜爾的若干壁畫幾乎相同。在那裏，這種說法圖也是在突出的中楣正下方，從中楣開始是山洞狀的天井。各說法圖被联珠纹的邊隔開，而在本圖中，是用小的方形金箔隔開。</p><p>霍拉的佛寺建於平地，並不是如克孜爾那樣在懸崖上鑿窟的形式。斯坦因從這佛寺僅發現了少量的遺物（參照圖119），但其年代早，它們身上具備的特質，可看出與尚未深受中國影響之前的5至6世紀庫車地區廣爲流傳的風格有密切關係。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 119"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.981</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="eng">Buddha seated in meditation</title><title lang="chi-Hant">佛坐像</title><note lang="eng"><p>5th century A.D.(?)</p><p>From Khora</p><p>Wood, with traces of pigment</p><p>H. 16.3 cm, W. 5.2 cm</p><p>MAS 981 (Khora. I. ii. 001)</p><p>This beautiful piece found in a small cella at Khora in the Karashahr Valley is very similar in size and style to the wooden Buddha found farther west near the large stupa at Tumshuk by Le Coq. Now in the Museum für Indische Kunst, Berlin, it was recently exhibited in New York (Le Coq, 1922, Vol. I, Pl.42; Along the Ancient Silk Routes, No. 47). Unlike the Stein Buddha, the Berlin figure has lost both its mandorla and nimbus, and also the base or throne. The figure of the Berlin Buddha is, however, somewhat larger, and its proportions are more satisfying. The carving of the Stein Buddha is less finished, showing many of the marks of the chisel, especially on the arms and torso. The latter is slender and tapering but bulges abruptly at the waist; the knees are pressed down parallel to the base, and since they do not extend beyond the base, help emphasize the spare and vertical torso. The arms are kept well separate and are sharply angled forward and inwards at the elbow. All of these features contrast with the gentler rhythms and smoother handling of plastic form in the Berlin Buddha.</p><p>The robe in each case is in the covering mode; on the Stein piece collar is indicated by a raised area running from shoulder to shoulder and dipping in the centre of the chest. In the Berlin figure the folds of the collar take the form of incised lines, gently twisting as the robe dips and widening slightly on the shoulder. In both, the robe drops symmetrically in folds from the wrists, forming a central panel with curved lower edge beneath the hands. Again, the Berlin figure is more finished, and its smooth robe, almost transparent except at the edges of the sleeves and collar, has been compared with Gupta sculptures from Sarnath.</p><p>The head of each figure is inclined forward, with high domed hair (particularly in the Stein piece), crowned by a very distinct usnisa, sharply angled in towards its base. The earlobes are particularly large, and in the Stein Buddha angled outwards until they reach the shoulders instead of falling straight.</p><p>At Dunhuang in the early caves, particularly Cave 259 of the Northern Wei (cf. Chugoku Sekkutsu, Tonko Makkokutsu, Vol. 1, Pl. 25), the same gentle type of meditating Buddha is found but in proportion and treatment closer to the Berlin figure than to the one shown here. Both pieces were once entirely covered with polychrome painting, which would have smoothed out some of the traces of the chisel; the other differences observable in the Stein figure may indicate a slightly earlier date, or a slightly less capable artist.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>5世紀？</p><p>霍拉出土</p><p>木雕彩色</p><p>高16.3釐米 寬5.2釐米</p><p>MAS981（Khora.I.ii.001）</p><p>此精美雕刻是從位於焉耆谷的霍拉的内殿發現的，無論是尺寸還是風格上，它與勒柯克從西邊遙遠的圖木舒克遺迹的大佛塔附近發現的木雕佛像極其相似，現在那像已成爲柏林印度美術館的收藏品，最近在紐約展覽（參照“Le Coq” 1922,I,圖42，Along the Ancient Silk Routes, No. 47）。柏林收藏的坐像與斯坦因收藏品中的坐像不一樣，頭光和身光已殘缺，台座和基壇也沒有了。然而，柏林的佛坐像的高要大幾分，比例更加和諧。斯坦因收集品中的像雕刻尚未完工，手臂、身體等處都留著鑿刻痕迹。身體苗條，越往下越細，而腹部卻鼓起。膝蓋爲符合基壇而表現窄小，基本沒有越出基壇外，使細而直立的身體很顯眼。兩臂與軀體隔開斜著垂下，肘部做出的角度彎向前方內側。這種表現均與柏林像的沈穩格調和感覺平滑流暢的處理形成對比。</p><p>雙方的衣服都是通肩的，斯坦因收集品中的像上，搭在兩肩間的衣領隆起，中央部分在胸前降低。而柏林的像，衣領上加了刻線，表現的是寬鬆地披在肩上的樣子。兩者的衣袖都從左右手腕對稱地垂下，兩手之下的部分，是下邊成圓形的板狀。前面曾講過，柏林像基本完成，流暢的衣紋除了在袖口和領子邊，均表現得極薄，使人想起Sarnath笈多時期的雕刻。</p><p>兩像的頭部都向前傾，髮型呈高圓頂狀（尤其是斯坦因收集品更明显），頂部有肉髻。另外，斯坦因收集的像，耳垂特別大，不是筆直地向下，而是爲了不觸到肩，使耳垂朝外。</p><p>敦煌早期的石窟，特別是北魏時期的第259窟（參照《中國石窟 敦煌莫高窟》第1卷第25圖）中，有結定印的同類佛坐像，但其比例和表現上的處理方法，比此像更接近柏林的像。兩像當初都上過色彩，大概是因經過多少次的鑿刻，那彩色已被抹掉。像這樣，把斯坦因收集的此像，與其他像進行詳細比較觀察，則可以判斷出，此像的年代到底比其他像還要早些呢，還是因出自技術粗劣的作家之手呢？</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 3 Plate 120"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">MAS.1125</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><title lang="san ">Fragment from a Paradise of Maitreya (?)</title><title lang="chi-Hant">彌勒下生經變相圖斷片？</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 9th-10th century A.D.</p><p>From Toyuk</p><p>Ink on hemp cloth</p><p>H. 21.0 cm, W. 20.5 cm</p><p>MAS 1125 (Toyuk.

They had, he thought, been thrown out from the Buddhist shrines along the Toyuk Gorge in the course of some previous exploration. This small fragment of a large painting was probably picked up in the same way; it is one of the few objects found by Stein not explicitly listed in his report.</p><p>The fragment depicts the shaving of an important personage, in much the same way as the shaving of a nobleman and his wife in the Maitreya paradise (Vol. 2, Pl. 12-6). We may note not only the figure kneeling with a basin to receive the locks of hair as they are cut and the other members of the entourage seated on a dais but also the roof of a small hexagonal kiosk, again recalling the one seen in the same part of the silk painting. The execution resembles that of a preparatory sketch rather than of a finished painting, like the sketches on paper from Dunhuang (Vol. 2, Figs. 85-90).</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，9～10世紀</p><p>吐峪溝出土</p><p>麻布設色</p><p>21.0釐米 寬20.5釐米</p><p>MAS1125(Toyuk.E)</p><p>斯坦因從有名的葡萄産地吐魯番盆地的小城吐峪溝，收集到很多漢文經卷。據他考察，那些經卷是被在他之前探訪这里的探險隊從沿吐峪溝溪谷的佛寺中扔出的。此斷片僅是大型繪畫的一小部分，也許是同一種途徑得到的。在斯坦因發現的無數遺物中，此是少數未被收錄報告書中的作品之一。</p><p>此斷片，採用了與《彌勒下生經變相圖》（第2卷圖12-6）中所見的貴族及其夫人剃髮場面大致相同的手法，繪著一個貴族剃髮的場面。這裏描繪的是一個貴人剃完髮的剃髮場面。不僅有跪著捧盤接起剪掉頭髮的人，和坐在壇上的人物，還有小六角亭的屋脊等，這都使人想起絹繪中的剃髮部分。其描寫比完整的畫更接近敦煌出土的紙繪粉本（第2卷Figs. 85-90）那樣製作的畫稿類。</p></note></msContents></msDescription></body></text></TEI.2>
