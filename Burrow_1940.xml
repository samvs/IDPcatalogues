Obscure passages remain to be cleared up; the meaning of many words is still unknown. Nevertheless it is time the attempt was made, since it is essential for further advance in the study of the many questions, philological and other, connected with the documents, that they should be made accessible to a wider circle of schoalrs than has hitherto been the case. this can only be done by a translation, literal, and as accurate as possible.</p><p>A great deal, of course, can be made out with certainty. In such cases the straightforward translation is given. In many cases where the meaning of a word is not known, the rest of the sentence is clear, and is translated with the unknown word in italics. Titles like<term>cozbo</term>, etc., whose meaning is known roughly are normally left in italics. Wherever there is doubt about the rendering of a particular passage, a question mark is added in brackets at the end. When nothing can be made of a passage, a space in brackets containing a question mark is inserted. Lacunae in the original are represented by a line of dots within squared brackets. Set phrases that occur again and again are not translated after the first time, being identified by etc. and a line of dots.</p><p>No extensive annotation is given. The basis of the interpretation is to be found in my<title>Language of the Kharoṣṭhi Documents from Chinese Turkestan</title>, to which the reader is referred. Short notes are made (a) to correct the readings of the text, (b) wherever the information in the above work needs to be supplemented or corrected. At the end of the volume there is an index of the words thus discussed in the notes. An asterisk is placed before new words resulting from improved readings, a cross before those which should be deleted. A certain amount of other information on individual words is also incorporated there.</p><p>On the completion of the edition by Professor Rapson and his colleagues, the documents were divided between this country and India. The originals of Nos. 213–427 and 510–565 are now lodged in the British Museum, and the rest are in Delhi. Apart from photographs, therefore, I have only seen the originals of the numbers mentioned above. Corrections in the notes in these documents are based on an examination of the originals. In the case of the rest, where photographs, as in the majority of cases, are not available, they are either based on alternatives suggested by editors themselves or conjectural. The lack of access to the originals is a handicap in the first two hundred documents. Later, in the second and third volumes, when the editors were more sure of themselves it is not so serious.</p><p>Documents containing only lists of names, and those too fragmentary to translate, are omitted.</p></head><body><msDescription n="1"><msIdentifier><settlement>New Delhi</settlement><repository>The National Library of India</repository><collection>Stein</collection><idno type="unknown">Unknown</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="Obv."><note><p>[Manuscript in the National Library of India, New Delhi: not currently available on IDP.]</p></note><note><p>To be given to the<term>cozbo</term>Taṃjaka.</p><p>His majesty the king writes, he instructs the<term>cozbo</term>Taṃjaka

                            made according to law; if you are not clear about it there, they must be

                            Lýimsu's hand there is some corn of mine on loan. As regards the
                            previous (lot) of corn, the<term>vaṣḍhiǵaiṃ</term>(lot) which we
                            received here, you know the reckoning of it. The second lot is from the
                            ploughed field (and) you know the reckoning of it. It is in Saṃghas̱ena's
                            hand. The amount of that corn which has been used up or given to others,
                            has been entered on a tablet. The amount of corn remaining from that is
                            five<term>milima</term>ten<term>khi</term>. That corn is to be
                            demanded of Saṃghas̱ena along with interest. As regards the<term>vaṣḍhiǵaiṃ</term>corn, and the corn from the field, reckoning
                            is to be made separately. The corn from<term>paniṃcana</term>is ten<term>khi</term>. A reckoning of that is to be made along with the
                            interest. As regards the previous corn, reckoning is to be made in
                            detail for each year individually. As regards last year's corn in
                            Caṃpe's hand, Kuteya knows how much came off the threshing floor. Also a
                            reckoning is to be made of the corn Campe has. Also you know the
                            reckoning of the wine which Kole has. Now there is room for some wine
                            from him.

                            however, the text reads<term>śamuṃta</term>instead of<term>śamuḍa</term>here. Further, the passage in 387 runs:<term>śamuṃta rayana iṃci vis̱ajidavya</term>. As the particle<term>iṃci</term>is only used in the documents to strengthen the
                            negatives<term>na</term>and<term>ma</term>, it is clear that the
                            syllable<term>na</term>in this passage is the negative "not" and has
                            to be connected with the<term>iṃci</term>following it, and cannot form
                            part of the preceding word (as it is printed). We must therefore take
                            the word as<term>śamuṃta-raya</term>not<term>śamuṃta rayana</term>,
                            unless we assume that the scribe has omitted one syllable<term>na</term>. If that is so the<term>śamuḍa rayana</term>in
                            this passage must be from the context a genitive plural, and the context
                            further suggests that it is some animal that lives on meat. The term<term>aṃgha</term>(=<term>aṅka</term>) "mark" is quite in
                            conformity with this, since they would be marked if they were animals.

                            from there a letter of information in the hand of the<term>toṃga</term>Vukto; from that I the great king learnt about everything. Also it

                            formerly settled, there they have settled. In your province there has
                            come about a relaxation. Also there is peace and quiet from Khotan. Now
                            the<term>lautǵaiṃci</term>people are to be written down. Only the city
                            is to be defended; the other people of the kingdom are to be left alone;
                            they are not again to be harassed (by being crowded) in the city. Also
                            last year the royal<term>śuka</term>wine was collected there. Now it
                            is heard that the tax-collectors and officials of wine department have

                            one and the hire be paid from the state at a regular rate, so that the
                            affairs of state shall not in any way become slack. Also let lucerne for

                            are to be prevented from persecuting the debtor people. When there is
                            peace and quiet from Khotan and the kingdom is stable, at that time they
                            will pay. Also it is heard that there the serviceable well-born people
                            are very much disobeying the<term>cozbo</term>Soṃjaka. They do not do

                            in Caḍ́ota the monk Anaṃdasena received 30<term>milima</term>of corn
                            on loan from Cuǵopa. Further he received 15<term>khi</term>of wine on
                            loan. In addition the slave of this monk Anaṃdas̱ena, Budhagoṣa by name,
                            he stole from the house of me (and) Cuǵopa 12 lengths of silk
                                (<term>paṭa</term>) and also 3<term>urnavaraṇḍe</term>, 2 ropes

                                (<term>sarvapiṃḍa-gaṃnanena</term>) to the value of 100<term>muli</term>. Concerning this matter Cuǵopa swore an oath. Thus
                            the whole was to be paid over by the monk Anaṃdas̱ena and received by
                            Cuǵopa and Larsu. Further that monk was owing at the court
                                (<term>dvara[ṃmi]</term>) a fine of one cow. Now again the monk
                            Anaṃdas̱ena made representations with Larsu and made efforts. So Larsu
                            desirous of acquiring merit together with the monk Anaṃdas̱ena, they
                            came to an agreement with each other outside (the court). This monk gave
                            the thief man Budhagoṣa to Larsu as equivalent to the value (namely) 110<term>muli</term>of the corn Anaṃdas̱ena received on loan and the
                            twelve lengths of cloth (etc.) that were stolen. Also the<term>cozbo</term>Larsu abandoned his claims against the monk
                            Anaṃdas̱ena for this 110<term>muli</term>. From this day forth Larsu
                            shall have no claim against the monk Anaṃdas̱ena concerning this 110<term>muli</term>and the [thefts] of his slave. Neither shall the

                            stir up a dispute about the decision, in such a case their renewal of

                            Naturally such a form cannot belong to this dialect. Since<term>nissaya</term>is well known as a specifically Buddhist term
                            meaning the fundamental requisites of life, the word is obviously

                            2nd month, 12th day, in this reign, there is a man of Caḍ́ota, Koṃpala

                            Budhasena and Maṣḍhiǵe. The value of that girl was reckoned at
                            forty-five<term>muli</term>, and they made the agreement. So this Koṃpala and Suḡ́i
                            received one<term>viyala</term>camel worth 42<term>muli</term>. The remaining 3<term>muli</term>was kept

                            examined (the dispute) and made a decision. So the<term>caṃkura</term>has given

                             so now that girl Saǵanāpaae has become the property of this Maṣḍhiǵe.
                            Even so as a remnant of the first price was kept back, so now that price
                            is to be received with one addition (<term>eka ayoǵena</term>). The sum
                            (is now) five. (Payment of) anything else is prevented, and the total

                            alleged) that Pǵiya, a slave of Moǵe and Cimaka, had a fight
                                (<term>kalihari</term>) with Ropǵeya the father of Opǵe. They struck
                            each other. Afterwards that Pǵiya, slave of Moǵeya and Cimaka, fled. He
                            is not alive, nor has he been seen dead. After that Opǵeya's father
                            Ropǵeya[. . .] they gave a boy to Moǵe and Cimaǵa, a man called Bhiyaǵa.
                            Now this man Bhiyaǵa [has fled ] at a later time no one was able to say
                            anything about the man Bhiyaǵa. After that this Pǵi turned out to be in
                            Khema. Moǵeya and Cimaǵa got him from therewith a price paid out of
                            their own property. He died with them. On account of him there is no
                            quarrel. There is a quarrel concerning camels. There has been a decision
                            about everything. These people have no claim to payment from one
                            another.</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="713"><msIdentifier><settlement>New Delhi</settlement><repository>The National Library of India</repository><collection>Stein</collection><idno type="unknown">Unknown</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="Obv."><note><p>[Manuscript in the National Library of India, New Delhi: not currently available on IDP.]</p></note><note><p>To the<term>ṣoṭhaṃgha</term>Lýipeya. . . . . the<term>cozbo</term>Taǵira,

                            has resulted in everything being decided. The warriors (?) have taken

                            of the taxation in Ajiyama Av́ana. Just as formerly the tax was assessed
                            in Ajiyama Av́ana (as follows, namely): ghee, sheep,<term>kośava</term>,<term>arnavaj́i</term>, carpet (<term>thavastae</term>),<term>raj́i</term>,
                            felt (<term>naṃmatae</term>),<term>cāṃdri</term>, and<term>kaṃmaṃta</term>; in

                            the rest of the tax; so now it is quickly to be sent here all complete
                            in the hand of the<term>aǵeta</term>Lýipeya and Tsuǵeta. The tax of
                            the<term>v́eǵa kilme</term>women is to be demanded all complete. Also
                            in the rainy season (<term>varṣavasaṃmi</term>) you<term>vásus</term>,<term>aǵetas</term>, and<term>yatmas</term>must come herein the
                            fourth month from the exterior provinces and the central kingdom (?).
                            There is an investigation into the conditions of taxation. He who really
                            does provide his tax (well and good); he who does not is to be removed.
                            Also you have a yearly deficit in your tax returns. If you again send
                            the tax short, you will certainly pay from your own establishment. Just
                            as formerly provisions were given to messengers so now they are to be
                            taken by Tsuǵeta. You have cut off the tax from your own farm year by

Opǵeya and Upas̱ena make a representation
                            here now. Opǵe reports: When my son Upas̱ena was born Lýimo adopted him,
                            and thus he (Lýimo) spoke: Whatever people there are depending on me,
                            many or few, among these Upas̱ena shall be as an eldest son. They shall
                            live in dependence on him. That Lýimo died [. . . ] slave people and the
                            [. . . ] people of the master upset the agreement. They do not obey (?)
                            this Upas̱ena. Considering this, of this family Opǵe [. . .</p><p>(31) . . . ] whatever Opǵe shall command the slaves concerning the
                            household duties, they must act according to his word, they must not
                            transgress. This Upas̱ena is to be regarded as an adopted son in that
                            family. Whatever law of the kingdom and what family (?) law the rest of
                            the Caḍ́otans observe, in such a way these people must act. Whoever have
                            doubts whether there is any ruling on that point, shall complain here in
                            our presence and there will be a decision. Also as regards the
                            transaction between Lýimo and Puǵo at the time the kingdom was tranquil,
                            they are now making trouble about that here. When the kingdom shall
                            (again) be tranquil, there will be a decision about this.</p></note><note><p>Note: For<term>upajiva tusa Lýimo</term>read<term>upajivatu sa
