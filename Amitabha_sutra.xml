                                Jeta Grove in the Garden of the Benefactor of Orphans and the
                                Forlorn, together with a gathering of Great Bhikshus, twelve-hundred
                                fifty in all, all Great Arhats well-known to the assembly: Elders
                                Shariputra, Mahamaudgalyayana, Mahakasyapa, Mahakatyayana,
                                Mahakausthila, Revata, Suddhipanthaka, Nanda, Ananda, Rahula,
                                Gavampati, Pindola-Bharadvaja, Kalodayin, Mahakaphina, Vakkula,
                                Aniruddha, and others such as these, all Great Disciples, together
                                with all the Bodhisattvas, Mahasattvas: Manjushri, Prince of Dharma;
                                Ajita Bodhisattva, Gandhastin Bodhisattva, Nityodukta Bodhisattva,
                                and others such as these, all Great Bodhisattvas, and together with
                                Shakra, Chief among Gods, and the numberless great multitudes from
                                all the heavens.</p><p>At that time, the Buddha told the Elder Shariputra, From here,
                                passing through hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhalands to
                                the West there is a world called Utmost Happiness. In this land a
                                Buddha called Amitabha right now teaches the Dharma.</p><p>Shariputra, why is this land called Utmost Happiness? All living
                                beings of this country never suffer, but enjoy every bliss.
                                Therefore it is called Utmost Happiness.</p><p>Moreover, Shariputra, this land of Utmost Happiness is completely
                                surrounded by seven tiers of railings, seven layers of netting, and
                                seven rows of trees, all formed from the four treasures, and for
                                this reason called Utmost Happiness.</p><p>Moreover, Shariputra, in the land of Utmost Happiness are pools of
                                the seven jewels, filled with the waters of eight meritorious
                                qualities; the bottom of each pool is pure, covered with golden
                                sands. On the four sides climb stairs of gold, silver, lapus lazuli,
                                crystal, mother-of pearl, rubies, and carnelian.</p><p>In the pools bloom lotuses as large as carriage wheels with colors of
                                green light, red light, yellow light, and white light, subtle, rare,
                                fragrant, and pure. Shariputra, the Land of Utmost Happiness is
                                crowned in splendor and virtues such as these.</p><p>Moreover, Shariputra, in this Buddhaland heavenly music always plays,
                                and the ground is made of gold. In the six periods of the day and
                                night a heavenly rain of mandarava flowers falls, and throughout the
                                clear morning, each living being of this land offers sacks filled
                                with myriads of wonderful flowers to the hundreds of thousands of
                                millions of Buddhas of the other directions. At mealtime they return
                                to their own countries and after eating they walk about. Shariputra,
                                the Land of Utmost Happiness is crowned in splendor and virtues such
                                as these.</p><p>Moreover, Shariputra, in this country there are always rare and
                                unusual birds of many kinds and colors: white geese, cranes,
                                peacocks, parrots, egrets, kalavinkas and two-headed birds. In the
                                six periods of the day and night the flocks of birds sing forth
                                harmonious and elegant sounds. Their clear and joyful calls proclaim
                                the Five Roots, the Five Powers, the Seven Limbs of Bodhi, the
                                Eightfold Path of Sages, and dharmas such as these. When living
                                beings of this land hear their calls they are altogether mindful of
                                the Buddha, mindful of the Dharma, and mindful of the Sangha.</p><p>Shariputra! Do not say that these birds are born as retribution for
                                their sins. And why not? Because in this Buddhaland the three evil
                                paths do not exist. Shariputra, even the names of the three evil
                                paths are unknown in this Buddha's land; how much the less could
                                they actually exist! Wishing to proclaim the Dharma's sound far and
                                wide, Amitabha Buddha created these multitudes of birds by
                                transformation.</p><p>Shariputra, in that Buddhaland when the gentle winds blow, the rows
                                of jewelled trees and jewelled nets reverberate with fine and
                                wondrous sounds, as a symphony of one hundred thousand kinds of
                                music played in harmony. All who hear these sounds are naturally
                                mindful of the Buddha, mindful of the Dharma, and mindful of the
                                Sangha. Shariputra, the Land of Utmost Happiness is crowned in
                                splendor and virtues such as these.</p><p>Shariputra, what do you think? Why is this Buddha called Amitabha?
                                Shariputra, the brilliance of that Buddha's light is measureless,
                                illumining the lands of the ten directions everywhere without
                                obstruction. For this reason he is called Amitabha.</p><p>Moreover, Shariputra, the lifespan of that Buddha and that of his
                                people extends for measureless, limitless asamkhyeyas of kalpas. For
                                this reason he is called Amitayus. And, Shariputra, since Amitabha
                                became a Buddha, ten kalpas have passed.</p><p>Moreover, Shariputra, that Buddha has measureless, limitless
                                asamkheyas of Sound-Hearer disciples, their number incalculable. So
                                too is the assembly of Bodhisattvas. Shariputra, that Buddhaland is
                                crowned in splendor and virtues such as these.</p><p>Moreover, Shariputra, the living beings born in the Land of Utmost
                                Happiness are all avaivartika. Among them are many who in this very
                                life will dwell in Buddhahood. Their number is extremely many; it is
                                incalculable. And only in measureless, limitless asamkyeyas of
                                kalpas could they be counted.</p><p>Shariputra, those living beings who hear of this should vow: I wish
                                to be born in that country. And why? Because those who are born
                                there assemble in one place with people whose goodness is
                                unsurpassed. Shariputra, if one has few good roots, blessings, and
                                virtues, one cannot be born in that land.</p><p>Shariputra, if there is a good man or good woman who hears of
                                Amitabha and holds his name whether for one day, two days, three,
                                four, five days, six days, as long as seven days with one mind
                                unconfused, when this person nears the end of life, before him will
                                appear Amitabha and all the Assembly of Holy Ones. When the end
                                comes, his mind will not be utterly confused, and in Amitabha's Land
                                of Utmost Happiness he will quickly be reborn. Shariputra, because I
                                see this benefit, I speak these words; and, if living beings hear
                                this teaching they should make the vow: I wish to born in that land.</p><p>Shariputra, just as I now praise the inconceivable benefits arising
                                from the merit and virtue of Amitabha, so too in the East does
                                Akshobya Buddha, Sumeru Likeness Buddha, Great Sumeru Buddha, Sumeru
                                Light Buddha, Wonderful Sound Buddha; all Buddhas such as these,

                                vast and far-reaching sound that pervades the threefold, great,
                                thousand-world realm and proclaims these sincere and honest words:

                                Buddhas protect and bear in mind? Shariputra, if a good man or good
                                woman hears this sutra and upholds it, and hears the names of all
                                these Buddhas, this good man or good woman will also be one whom all
                                Buddhas protect and bear in mind, and will attain non-retreat from
                                anuttarasamyaksambodhi. Therefore, Shariputra, all of you should
                                believe and accept my words and the words all Buddhas speak.</p><p>Shariputra, if there are people who have already made the vow, who
                                now make the vow, or who will make the vow, I wish to be born in
                                Amitabha's country, these people, whether born in the past, now
                                being born there, or to be born there in the future, will all attain
                                non-retreat from anuttarasamyaksambodhi. Therefore, Shariputra, all
                                good men and good women who believe should make the vow, I wish to
                                be born in that country.</p><p>Shariputra, just as I now praise the inconceivable merit and virtue
                                of all Buddhas, all those Buddhas also praise my inconceivable merit
                                and virtue, saying these words: Shakyamuni Buddha can accomplish
                                extremely difficult and rare deeds in the Saha Land during the evil
                                time of the Five Turbidities: during the time turbidity, the views

                                and the lifespan turbidity. He can attain anuttarasamyaksambodhi and
                                for the sake of living beings proclaim this Dharma, which the whole
                                world finds hard to believe.</p><p>Shariputra, you should know that I, in the evil time of the Five
                                Turbidities, perform these difficult deeds, attain
                                anuttarasamyaksambodhi, and for the entire world proclaim this
                                Dharma which is difficult to believe, extremely difficult!</p><p>After the Buddha spoke this Sutra, Shariputra, all the Bhikshus, and
