Ch. liii. 005</p><p>This impressive standing figure of the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, holding a willow spray in his right hand and a sprinkler vase in his left, displays features shared with other representations of the same Bodhisattva, such as those shown in Pls. 2 and 3 and in Vol. 1, Pl. 23.</p><p>The suggestion for a possible date in the second half of the ninth century arises from resemblances to the dated painting of four Avalokitesvaras, Manjusri and Samantabhadra, dedicated in A.D. 864 (Vol. 1, Pl. 23). The four figures there do not display the same swaying pose as the present painting, but the general outline of the face and arrangement of the headdress is very similar. Beginning with the headdress, the hair is seen above an elaborate crown, in a high chignon. Below the crown, the hair frames the forehead in a smooth curve, and around the ears and the upper part of the shoulders as a continuous narrow black edging. The nimbus is also of the same type as two of those in the dated painting, with a single outer band ornamented with cloud motifs. Turning to the garments, the upper half of the body, clearly under Indian influence, is unclothed save for ornaments and scarves. Behind the shoulders, the apparently unsupported double loop of one of the latter again recalls the four Avalokitesvaras of the dated painting, as does the yellow and orange under-robe with its agitated pattern of folds.</p><p>In both paintings, but especially in the present one, it is clear that considerable attention was paid to achieving a harmonious balance of curving forms. There is under-drawing in a pale red as well as in ink, and darker ink has been used to accent salient features such as the eyelids and the mouthline. The latter shows the first signs of a development from a plain line with swelling ends to a hooked form. It is interesting to note that the final accenting lines in a darker ink quite often ignore the outlines earlier laid down in red or pale ink, suggesting that a different hand or master painter was responsible for adding the final touches.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，9世紀後半葉</p><p>絹本設色</p><p>高148.釐米 寬55.9釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫13.Ch.liii.005</p><p>此精美的觀世音菩薩立像，右手持小柳枝，左手持淨瓶，姿態與圖2、3以及第1卷圖23等的觀音像相同。</p><p>此畫與有咸通五年（864年）題記的四觀音文殊普賢圖（參照第1卷圖23）中的四觀音描繪極其相近，推斷其製作年代爲9世紀後半葉。那四觀音的姿勢中不見與該繪畫一樣的動態，但臉部的輪廓線和髮型的描繪等都很相似。頭髮先高高盤在華麗的寶冠上，然後垂下，在額上描出流暢的弧形，繞過耳朵背後到肩上，好像是黑色的鑲邊圈起了臉。邊緣飾有雙雲渦文的頭光的形式，也和四觀音中的兩身相同。</p><p>注意其衣著，上半身只披瓔珞、天衣和綬帶等，幾近裸身，殘留了很濃的受印度影響的痕迹。肩頭的雙層的輪形裝飾綬帶很突出，黃色和橙色裙褶線等，也使人想起四觀音的描繪。雖然四觀音也那樣，但尤其是本圖的觀音，在保持均衡的身體曲線上下了很大功夫。底稿的線不僅用墨，也用了淡紅色，像眼瞼和嘴唇等特別引人注目的部分，則用濃墨強調。其嘴唇部分的描繪，相當於唇線兩端稍作膨脹的簡單表現向鈎狀表現轉移的第一階段。而進入完成階段的濃墨的勾勒線，隨處有不顧底稿的淡墨和紅線的地方，引人注目。這會使人想象，完工的線是由其他畫家或者匠師完成的，非常有趣。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 2"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.21</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="san-Latn">Avalokitesvara</title><title lang="chi-Hant">觀世音菩薩像</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 2nd half of the 9th century A.D</p><p>Ink and colours on silk</p><p>H. 74.7cm, W. 55.5 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting21.

The formality of the central figure, with its well-rounded outlines, large face and long arms, and stylized pattern of scarves and ornaments, contrasts with the informal depiction of these two children.

Ch. 0088</p><p>The Bodhisattva stands on a lotus pedestal with downturned petals, between two large waving stems with three-petalled flowers intended for lotuses; the topmost flower on the left stem has a fully developed lotus pod. From his shoulders a dark green scarf spirals downwards, in contrast to the upward movement of the flowering stems. In his right hand he holds a willow spray, and in his left a sprinkler vase with a single flower stem somewhat improbably issuing from its tapering mouth.</p><p>The depiction of the face and torso is for the most part in smooth curves, giving rather full outlines to the face, with plump chest and arms. The hair is shown as a smooth arch over the forehead, with thick black segments behind the shoulders and a high topknot. Some of these features are also visible in Pl.2, and together with details of the garments such as the exaggerated loops of the shorter shoulder scarf, ending just below the elbows, can be compared with, for instance, Vol. 1, Pl.23, which is dated in the fifth year of Xiantong 咸通五年 (A.D. 864), and with Stein painting 391 (Ch. 00451, in the National Museum of India, New Delhi), dated with a cyclical combination (甲申十一月) corresponding to the same year, A.D. 864 (Stein, Thousand Buddhas, Pl. XLIV). A date in the second half of the ninth century is therefore suggested for this work. The construction is somewhat unusual in that a half-width of silk is sewn down the right side of the painting only. The painting has lost its original borders.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，9世紀後半葉</p><p>絹本設色</p><p>高103.1釐米 寬71.2釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫22.Ch.0088</p><p>此觀音站在覆瓣的蓮華座上，兩旁好像蓮花樣的帶有三瓣花的植物莖，彎彎曲曲高高挺立著。左側莖上端的花瓣已落，剩下種子。觀音手臂上濃綠色的天衣螺旋狀卷著，與挺立的帶花的莖的變化相對。觀音右手持柳條枝，左手持淨瓶，淨瓶細口中插入一枝頭上有朵小花的彎曲植物。</p><p>臉和上半身的曲線表現基本流暢，臉、胸部、手臂很豐滿。頭髮在寶冠上高高梳起，在額的部分繪成優美的弧線，從兩肩後垂下。使用濃墨，輪廓線鮮明。上一圖中也出現了這種髮型和衣著的細部描繪，特別是從肩到肘的短綬帶，在肩頭突出成兩層的輪形裝飾的表現等，可與有咸通五年（864年）紀年的四觀音文殊普賢圖（參照第1卷圖23）、及等於864年的干支題記“甲申年十一月”的新德里國立博物館收藏的作品（參照Serindia.Ch.00451,《千佛洞》圖版44）等相比，此作品的年代相當於9世紀後半葉。繪畫用絹的組成方式與通常略有不同，畫面右半部只續接了半幅絹。沒有邊絹。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 4"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.7</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="san-Latn">Avalokitesvara</title><title lang="chi-Hant">觀世音菩薩像</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 9th century A.D</p><p>Ink and colours on silk</p><p>H.57.5 cm, W.38.1 cm (including border)</p><p>Stein painting7. Ch. xviii. 003</p><p>The Bodhisattva, standing facing the spectator with the head turned slightly to the left, holds a willow branch in his right hand and a small blue vase with gilt rim and foot in the upturned palm of his left hand. Blue is also used for the Bodhisattva’s hair, jewels, and the pattern and lining of his skirt. Apart from four individual flowers falling in the air around his flame-circled nimbus, there are no background features. The figure was originally outlined in red with fine ink lines, all now barely visible in the upper part of the body. The plain green halo with finely drawn flames invites comparison with the dated Avalokitesvara of A.D. 910 (Pl.7); hence a late ninth century date is suggested for this picture.</p><p>The painting is on a much smaller scale than most of the other Avalokitesvaras in the collection, being similar in size to the Ksitigarbha of Pl. 8. A painted orange border, outlined in yellow inside and in ink outside, runs around the four sides and shows that this painting was complete as it stands, without a sewn-on border. The brightness of the colours must originally have given it a jewel-like quality.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，9世紀</p><p>絹本設色</p><p>高（含絹邊）57.5釐米 寬（含絹邊）38.1釐米</p><p>斯坦因繪畫7.Ch.xviii.003</p><p>此觀音正面站立，頭稍微右歪。右手持小柳枝，左手掌托著壺嘴邊和底部是金彩的青色小壺。觀音的頭髮、瓔珞、裳的花紋和裏子等都是用同樣的青色。背景除了火焰光周圍的空中飄舞的四個散花外，沒有描繪其他事物。原來用墨和紅色描出的輪廓線，現在已褪色，只有上半身可勉強辨出。美麗的火焰圍繞的綠色頭光，比有天復十年（910年）紀年的觀世音菩薩像（參照圖7）的頭光略早，因此此畫的年代相當於9世紀。</p><p>此畫是斯坦因收集品的觀世音菩薩像中的小型作品，與圖8的地藏菩薩尺寸大致相等。周邊可見內側是黃色、外側用墨框起的橙色描繪的裝裱。由此可知，此畫所示的現狀是完整的，原來就沒有縫綴絹邊。明亮的色彩當時一定使它具有類似珠寶的質感。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 5"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.10</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="san-Latn">Cintamanicakra</title><title lang="chi-Hant">如意輪觀音菩薩像</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 9th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on silk</p><p>H.111.0 cm, W.74.5 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting10. Ch. xxvi. 001</p><p>See also Figs. 1-4</p><p>The six-armed figure of Cintamanicakra dominates the painting by its large size. At the sides there is only room for a scrolling lotus stem rising to support two small Bodhisattva figures in the upper corners (Figs. 1, 2). Two equally small figures (Figs. 3, 4) in the lower corners kneel and gaze upwards, offering flowers, but they are very hard to make out clearly, and the space between them is almost entirely destroyed.</p><p>Despite this damage and the loss of pigments such as the golden yellow of the Bodhisattva’s body, the painting still retains an impressive coherence. The main figure is almost entirely contained within a large white aura, bordered with lotus flowers. The nimbus has a double-peaked wave pattern, and the aureole features white triangular points over rows of multi-coloured petals; both share a tight yellow “flame” border, Most of these features are found again in a larger painting of Cintamanicakra that is at present too fragmentary to reproduce in colour (Vol.1, Fig. 68). There, however, despite the larger size of the whole painting, the central figure is in fact smaller and more space is given to the eight smaller Bodhisattvas and the four guardian kings.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，9世紀後半葉</p><p>絹本設色</p><p>高111.0釐米 寬74.5釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫10.Ch.xxvi.001</p><p>參照Figs.1－4</p><p>六臂如意輪觀音非常大地被描繪在整個畫面上，僅在兩旁留下的空白處有蜿蜒豎立的蓮花莖，支撐著畫面兩个上角的小菩薩像（參照Figs.1、2）。畫面的兩個下角跪著同樣的小像（參照Figs.3、4），手捧著花仰望上方，由於褪色和變色，很難辨清。兩者中間的絹也大面積缺損。</p><p>這種損傷是非常嚴重的，再者，如觀音身上所用的金色等，顔料多以脫落，但至今此畫仍保持原作品的完整性。主尊完全被收攏在蓮花鑲邊的白色大輪裏，頭光加入波狀文，背光有交錯配飾的白色三角形和紜繝彩色花紋。頭光和背光的外緣被一圈黃色的“火焰”帶圍起。與這種特點差不多的，也可在大畫面的如意輪觀音菩薩圖（參照第1卷Fig.68）中見到，由於那幅圖破損嚴重，沒有作爲彩色圖版刊出。其畫面比此圖還大，中尊描繪得略小，周圍留出空白，配了八身小菩薩像和四天王。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 6"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.17</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="san-Latn">Thousand-armed, Thousand-eyed Avalokitesvara</title><title lang="chi-Hant">千手千眼觀世音菩薩像</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 8th-early 9th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on silk</p><p>H.79.3 cm, W.62.0 cm</p><p>Stein painting17. Ch. xxxiii. 002</p><p>See also Figs. 5,6</p><p>As in the preceding plate, the central figure almost entirely fills the picture space, leaving room only for the Bodhisattvas of the Sun (Pl. 6-3) and of the Moon (Pl. 6-2) above, and the two unidentified donors below. The compression necessary to bring the canopy and the lotus pool within the picture has already been noted by Stein(Serindia, vol. Ⅱ, p.1037).</p><p>The arrangement of the Bodhisattvas of the Sun and Moon are a mirror-reversal of their positions in the very large painting of this subject (Vol. 1, Pl.18). In both cases it seems clear from the colour scheme that the artist intended them to appear on the same side as the sun and moon discs held as attributes by two of the forty principal hands. But in both paintings their vehicles have been exchanged: the Bodhisattva within the white disc (Pl.6-3) rides on the horses (properly belonging to Surya and the sun), while the Bodhisattva within the red disc rides on the geese (properly belonging to Candra) (Pl. 6-2). The painting on hemp (Fig. 55) shows the two Bodhisattvas on their correct vehicles and on the correct side with respect to the sun and moon discs held as attributes by the principal hands of the main deity.</p><p>Throughout the painting, but especially in the central figure, the final outlining is of a very precise character, matched by the clarity of the blue and red colours in particular. The halo is bordered by a closely set band of cloud scrolls in blue, and blue features prominently in the hair and scarves of the Bodhisattva as well as in the attributes held in his forty hands. The slightly twisted scarf visible on the Bodhisattva’s right shoulder and here and there elsewhere was originally decorated with bright white opaque dots. These and the multi-coloured petals of the lotus, rising out of the pool on a swirling base of cloud, allow us to imagine the splendid colouring of the painting when it was first made.</p><p>As Stein observed, the costumes of the donors (Figs. 5, 6) may be compared with that in the Sakyamuni paradise (Vol. 1, Pl. 11), and thus supports, along with the colouring and careful execution, the early ninth century as the latest possible date for, this painting. Traces where the border was once sewn on can be seen, especially down the left edge, but the border itself has not survived.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，8世紀～9世紀初</p><p>絹本設色</p><p>高79.3釐米 寬62.0釐米</p><p>斯坦因繪畫17.Ch.xxxiii.002</p><p>參照Figs.5、6</p><p>與上圖相同，除了上方兩角有日天（參照圖6－3）和月天（參照圖6－2），下方兩角各一不明身份供養人外，畫面幾乎被中尊佔據。正如斯坦因指出的，華蓋和蓮池只有經過壓縮才能放進畫面。</p><p>日天和月天的位置，與大畫面的千手千眼觀世音菩薩圖（第1卷圖18）中的左右位置相反。從圓相的配色看，顯然在這兩幅畫中，畫師都慾把最主要的四十隻手中的兩隻捧著日輪和月輪作爲象徵物的日天和月天均放在相同一側。而在此兩圖中，他們的坐騎卻互換了：紅色圓相中卻是騎著鵞鳥的月天，白色圓相中是騎著馬的日天。在本卷所收錄的麻繪千手千眼觀世音菩薩圖（參照Fig.55）中，顯示了日天和月天的正確的坐騎，他們也正確代表了主神的主要的四十隻手中的兩手捧的日輪和月輪。</p><p>此畫將精致的線描做到了每個角落，尤其是配以清楚的青色和紅色的中尊的線描非常完美。頭光外緣部分整齊排列著很密的青色的雲卷紋，菩薩的頭髮、天衣，或主要的四十隻手所持的象徵物等，都使用同樣的青色。隱約可見右肩垂落的略帶皺褶的天衣上，原來裝飾有明亮的小白點。上述這些，以及蓮池中升起的旋渦狀雲彩上的蓮華座那多彩的蓮瓣顔色，都使人不難想象此畫最初製作時的華麗的色彩和畫面。</p><p>正如斯坦因所說，供養人（參照Figs.5、6圖）的衣裳，可與《報恩經變相圖》（參照第1卷圖11）中供養人的作比對，以及從色彩的用法和精細的做工等看，此畫的年代不晚於9世紀初。有綴縫絹邊的痕迹—尤其左邊，但沒有残留的絹邊。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 7"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.14</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="san-Latn">Avalokitesvara</title><title lang="chi-Hant">觀世音菩薩像</title><note lang="eng"><p>Five Dynasties, but dated 10th year of Tianfu 天復 (the penultimate reign of Tang) (A.D.910)</p><p>Ink and colours on silk</p><p>H.77.0 cm, W. 48.9 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting14. Ch. liv. 006</p><p>See also Figs. 7,8</p><p>As is clear from the outset from the lengthy and well-written inscriptions, a great deal of care was lavished on the execution of this small votive painting of the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara. The principal inscription is on a green cartouche in the upper right-hand corner, in three columns starting on the left (Fig.7):</p><p>Praise to the great merciful, great compassionate saviour from hardship Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, in perpetual offering. Offered in the hope that the Empire may be peaceful and that the Wheel of the Law may continually turn therein. Secondly, on behalf of my elder sister and teacher, on behalf of the souls of my deceased parents, that they may be born again in the Pure Land, I reverently made this Great Holy One and with whole heart dedicated it. (Translation adapted from Waley, 1931, p. 26, who reads the columns in reverse order.)</p><p lang="chi-Hant">爲亡考妣神生淨土敬造大聖一心供養 奉爲 國界清平法輸常轉二爲阿姉師 南無大慈大悲救苦觀世音菩薩永充供養</p><p>The other inscriptions, including two additional ones on paper attached to the back of the painting (Fig. 8), identify the “elder sister and teacher” of this inscription as the deceased Very Reverend nun Yanhui, admitter to the Dharma and Vinaya in the monastery of Universal Light, who is seen on the left, while the very young man on the right is named as the probationary Chamberlain Zhang Youcheng, younger brother of the donor (Pl.7-3). Terukazu Akiyamu has kindly drawn my attention to the fact that the two longer inscriptions end with the formal phrase “finished and inscribed”畢功記: We shall find that this careful formality and stylization extends to the pictorial execution as well.</p><p>Several features of the picture deserve attention, particularly in view of the fact that it is dated; indeed the date itself, which appears in the longer inscription on the painting and again on the back, is of interest, since it is given as the tenth year of Tianfu, while that reign only lasted four years and the Tang dynasty itself had been deposed in A.D. 906. Evidently Dunhuang was fairly isolated from events in China at this time; nevertheless, under the patronage of powerful local families, such as the Cao 曹 family who were prominent at this time, caves continued to be opened on a grand scale. The ostentation of the time is perhaps evident here in the attention lavished on the nun Yanhui and the young boy. The inscription on the back makes it clear that they were intended as portraits, since the words 貌真 are used twice. In actual fact, of course, the two figures are almost as much standard types as the donors seen in other paintings, but they are sensitively painted and must accurately represent the costume of the time. The brightly coloured band across the chest of the nun’s garment and the black slipper with cloud-shaped toe, trimmed with red, add a touch of vanity, while the bright blue of her shaven head matches well with the azure locks of the Bodhisattva. The dress of the youthful chamberlain, the long black coat parted to the waist to reveal an underrobe of lighter colour (Pl.7-3), is of a type that will become familiar in many other tenth century donors.</p><p>The pink flesh tones used for the boy’s face are the same as those employed for the Bodhisattva (Pl.7-2). In the latter, the delicacy with which these tones are shaded and the darker outlines of the same colour have the effect of a pattern. We can note the symmetry of these outlines in the neck or at the elbow, while the blue hair envelops the shoulders in an airy tracery that is quite unlike the spreading locks on the shoulders of ninth century Bodhisattvas as seen in Vol. 1 (e.g., Pl.16-2). The face, as Waley observed, is perhaps disproportionately large, but it has lost the solidity still to be seen in the Bodhisattvas of the mid-ninth century (Vol. 1, Pl.23-3); and its outline has changed from oval to something almost rectangular. The eyebrows, in green lines sharply angled downwards to the nose, reflect this change, and the ink line of the mouth is sharply hooked at either end, a feature that will be exaggerated in later tenth century paintings. Some of these features may be helpful in attempting to date other works: the fine representation of Ksitigarbha (Pl. 8) is one such painting where the resemblance, particularly in colouring, suggests a similar date.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>五代時期，題記天復十年（910年）</p><p>絹本設色</p><p>高77.0釐米 寬48.9釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫14.Ch.liv.006</p><p>參照Figs.7、8</p><p>菩薩與其後跟隨的貴婦人，乘在外部有淺色暈染的雲彩上，都是斜的姿勢。菩薩上半身扭轉，臉稍向婦人，不像上圖的菩薩完全回頭看背後的婦人。婦人（參照圖10－3）的任何方面都使人感到是很富有、地位高的人物。她昂著頭，腰板挺直，與上一圖的婦人（參照圖9－3）似乎在受菩薩的保護和引導，低頭行進的嫺靜姿態形成鮮明對比。</p><p>爲亡考妣神生淨土敬造大聖一心供養，奉爲國界清平，法輸常轉，二爲阿姉師，南無大慈大悲救苦觀世音菩薩永充供養(根據Waley翻譯，1931年，p26，他以相反順序讀)</p><p>初看這個整齊的長篇題記，就可清楚地看出畫家在此觀世音菩薩的小型供養畫的製作上費了不少心思。最重要的題記在畫面右上角，綠色的長方形題箋中，從左開始共三行，記錄如下（參照Fig.7）。</p><p>南無大慈大悲救苦觀世音菩薩永充供養</p><p>南無大慈大悲救苦觀世音菩薩永充供養</p><p>爲亡考妣神生淨土敬造大聖一心供養</p><p>在其它的題記---包括附加的兩張貼在繪畫背面（參照Fig.8）紙上的題記中，稱 “姊師”的人，是亡者普光寺法律臨壇尼大德嚴會，她出現在畫面左側，右側的年輕人（參照圖7－3）是她的弟弟試殿中監張有成（裏面的題記中是張有誠）之像。秋山光和教授指出，兩個長篇題記末尾所使用的“畢功記”都是嚴格遵守固定格式寫成的，而且繪畫也同樣依照固定模式來製作。</p><p>此畫有幾點值得注意，特別是正面和背面的兩個題記中出現的紀年 “天復拾載庚午”更引人注意。此年號實際只用了四年就結束了，唐王朝本身也在906年滅亡。顯然此時敦煌與中國已經完全隔絕，但受當時最有名的曹家等地方豪族的贊助，大規模的石窟營造得以繼續。畫家精心描繪的嚴會尼和小男孩肖像也許能成爲當時誇耀和虛飾畫風的證據。背面的題記中兩度使用“貌真”一詞，說明是有意描繪的嚴會和張友成的肖像。乍一看這兩者的像，與其他繪畫中所見的描繪供養人像的標準形式基本無差別，然而細緻的描繪體現出衣著的時代特徵。著色鮮豔的嚴會尼的胸帶以及她的紅邊的黑色雲頭履等，多少增添了些華麗。剃髪光頭的美麗青色，與觀世音菩薩的淡青色毛髮協調。年輕的試殿中監張友成的衣裳，長黑色上衣兩邊自腰間向下叉開，露出白色的內衣（參照圖7－3），是此後10世紀的供養人像中常見的樣式。</p><p>張友成像臉上可見發粉的膚色暈染，與觀音臉上所使用的顔色相同。而觀音是用濃淡變化的暈染，用同一顔色的濃色線勾勒外沿，是略帶模式化的描繪（參照圖7－2）。這一點，還表現在左右對稱的脖頸和肘部等的線描上，也引人注目。但另一方面，披在肩上的青色頭髮像隨風搖擺的裝飾，顯得格外輕飄。此頭髮的描繪，與第1卷圖16的《藥師淨土圖》等，9世紀的菩薩（參照同一圖16－2）披在肩上的頭髮描繪完全不同。如Waley所述，比起身體，臉部大得有些不成比例，但9世紀中葉的菩薩像（參照第1卷圖23－3）的固定模式已消失。另外，臉部形狀，也從卵形逐漸變成長方形。綠色眉毛深深刻向鼻子，像是要和那棱角感對應，嘴唇兩端稍微往上翹。這種表現，到了10世紀後半葉，逐漸變得更加誇張。這些特徵，對其他作品的年代考證提供了參考，如下一圖所介紹的《地藏菩薩像》（圖8），特別是色彩使用上的類似性，可以看出與此畫是同時期的作品。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 8"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.4</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="san-Latn">Ksitigarbha</title><title lang="chi-Hant">地藏菩薩像</title><note lang="eng"><p>Five Dynasties, early 10th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on silk</p><p>H.55.5 cm, W. 39.8cm (including border)</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting4.

Here at Dunhuang this painting is representative of the hooded Ksitigarbha, where the Bodhisattva, who as usual wears a monk’s patched robe, is seen as a traveling monk, using his cape to cover his head. This iconographical type is unusual, since it has been found only at Dunhuang and subsequently in Korean paintings. It is not found at all in Buddhist paintings in Japan.

Ch. lvii. 002</p><p>This painting and the one shown in the following plate depict a theme that was clearly popular from the late Tang dynasty until the early Song. Not only these two paintings, But a further four paintings from Dunhuang in the Pelliot collection (Bannieres, Nos. 130-33) share the same composition. An earlier example, from the eighth century, is to be found as a wall painting in Cave 205 at Dunhuang itself (Dunhuang bihua, Pl. 149), but with the smaller figure standing in front of the Bodhisattva rather than behind.</p><p>Among the six examples on silk and paper it is the present one that is the most fully worked out, and the only one to bear a title, “Yinlu pu”,or “Bodhi-sattya Guide of Souls”. The general composition is the same in all six paintings, the Bodhisattva to the fore and the much smaller donor figure following behind, both supported on a cloud, which in this case has a long tail streamer descending from the top of the painting. The title, inscribed at the foot of the otherwise blank cartouche, gives no clue as to the more specific identity of the Bodhisattva guide, but Avalokitesvara might be suggested as the general model. However, it should be noted that there is also an association with Ksitigarbha since another painting in the Pelliot collection (Bannieres, No. 116) has the Bodhisattva alone, with a cartouche “Praise to the bodhisattva who leads the way” depicted in a separate panel balancing the donor below an inscribed and dated (A.D. 953) painting of Ksitigarbha and the Ten Kings.</p><p>In the present painting the Bodhisattva holds a hand-censer in his right hand and a lotus flower in his left (Pl. 9-2). From this lotus also hangs a white banner, divided into panels and with side and tail streamers, just as with the painted banners of Vol. 1 (Pl. 28ff) and the textile banners of Vol.3. Dark smoke is seen rising from the hand-censer towards the paradise buildings on another cloud in the upper left corner, while a scattering of individual flowers appears around the main figure. On the left side, a few tentative strokes in ink seem to sketch the beginning of a series of receding landscape banks, but the ground is otherwise plain and all the painter’s effort has been directed towards the figures.</p><p>The colouring of these is splendid and well preserved. Gold leaf has been used on the hand-censer and on the various items of jewellery worn by the Bodhisattva, as well as for the topmost chignon of his headdress. Gold leaf in small diamond shapes also adorns the raised black mass of hair of the soul being led to paradise (Pl. 9-3). Her coiffure, as has been noted (Fong, 1972, p. 179), resembles that of some of the ladies in the famous scroll by Emperor Huizong, Ladies Ironing Newly-Woven Silk, in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Their ornaments are matched in the Dunhuang painting by a comb which appears to be in the form of a white bird with outspread wings, the head of the bird being gilt, perhaps representing a comb made of white jade. From her whole attire, as well as from details such as her fashionable eyebrows, plucked and painted to resemble the antennae of a moth, the lady has the bearing of a noblewoman or even a princess.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，9世紀末</p><p>絹本設色</p><p>高80.5釐米 寬53.8釐米</p><p>斯坦因繪畫47.Ch.lvii.002</p><p>此畫和下圖作品的主題是唐代後半葉到宋初很常見的。除這兩件作品，還有四件相同構圖的作品（一件絹繪，三件紙繪），見於伯希和收藏品的敦煌畫（參照伯希和圖錄《敦煌的幡和繪畫》，圖版130～133）。另外，作爲早期的範例，可在敦煌第205窟的壁畫（參照《敦煌壁畫》，圖版149）中見到8世紀的作品，但那裏的小型人物像不在菩薩背後，而是站在前面。</p><p>在包括絹繪和紙繪的六件作品中，該作品是表現菩薩像最完整的一幅，又是有“引路菩（薩）”這一題記的唯一作品。六件的繪畫結構基本相同，前面描繪巨大的菩薩，其後跟隨死者小型的靈魂，兩者均乘於雲上。在本圖中，從畫面上方垂下一條長長的帶子，直至雲端。長方形題箋的下方除了記有小的標題外，無其他證明該菩薩爲引路菩薩的更明確的根據，不過此菩薩可能是觀音菩薩。無論如何，應該注意到該菩薩像還與地藏菩薩有關係，因爲在伯希和收藏品（伯希和《敦煌的幡和繪畫》，圖版116）中有一個單獨的菩薩像，添加了“南無引路菩薩” 的長方形題箋在下端供養人欄左側，有紀年（953年）的《地藏十王圖》（伯希和《敦煌的幡和繪畫》，圖版116）的下端供養人欄左側，描繪有一身菩薩，添加了記有 “南無引路菩薩” 的長方形題箋，可能和地藏菩薩信仰有關。</p><p>本圖的菩薩，右手持香爐，左手持蓮花，蓮花上懸挂著白色的幡。幡分成的四個區中描有花紋，兩邊是幡尾，下部有幡腳。這與第1卷圖28以後的絹繪的幡以及第3卷收錄的布質的幡屬同一類。香爐升起黑煙，其上方畫面的左上角，與菩薩所乘的雲彩不同，描繪的是黃色雲中的淨土建築物，另外，在菩薩周圍的空間，處處飛舞著花朵。左方中央偏下的位置可見似乎是試著描畫土坡的三根墨線，背景的其他部分沒畫任何事物，畫家把精力都傾注到畫像的描寫上了</p><p>畫面的色彩華麗，而且至今保持鮮豔。從手持的香爐到菩薩戴的珠寶以及頭頂的戴寶冠的髮髻都使用了金箔（參照圖9－2），菩薩背後跟隨的婦人髮飾上，也有小的菱形碎金箔（參照圖9－3）。如同Emperor Huizong指出的，那婦人的髮型，與波士頓美術館中有名的《徽宗摹張萱搗練圖卷》所畫的婦人像相似，猶如白鳥展開翅膀般的梳子，也和那些婦人们的髮飾相應，鳥的頭部鍍金，也許説明梳子是白玉製成的。從她的衣著，以及她時髦的修描得如同蛾觸角的眉毛看，這婦人是貴婦人或者甚至公主。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 10"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.46</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Avalokitesvara as Guide of Souls</title><title lang="chi-Hant">引路菩薩圖</title><note lang="eng"><p>Five Dynasties, early 10th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on silk</p><p>H.84.8 cm, W. 54.7 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting 46.

Perhaps this is the “sky-hook” referred to in the dated inscription (A.D. 956) of one of the long banners (Fig. 47). It certainly gives us a clue as to the possible use of the banners with triangular headpieces, free to twist and turn in the breeze as they were carried. Small diamonds of gold leaf adorn the streamers, and the main panel of the banner apparently imitates writing in red, but not in a recognizable script.</p><p>Both the Bodhisattva and the aristocratic figure behind him are supported on clouds, lightly silhouetted against pale colour shading. Both advance in three-quarter view, but the torso of the Bodhisattva is turned in a slight contrapposto to face the spectator, rather than being fully turned in a gesture to the lady behind as in Pl.9. The lady herself gives every impression of wealth and social standing (Pl. 10-3). Her stance is upright, in contrast to the downward glance and demure bearing that characterizes the lady of Pl.9-3, in harmony with the protective attitude of the Bodhisattva in that painting.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>五代時期，10世紀初</p><p>絹本設色</p><p>高84.8釐米 寬54.7釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫46.Ch.lvii.003</p><p>此畫與上一圖注釋中所講的伯希和收集品中的四件引路菩薩圖（絹繪1件，紙繪3件）很相似。菩薩右手持長竿，扛在肩上，寶冠上有化佛，顯然是觀世音菩薩。竿頭的金鈎上懸著幡，此鈎可能相當於顯德三年（956年）的長幡題記（參照Fig.47）中所記的“龍鈎”。不管怎樣，在畫中是吊著三角形的幡首部分，一邊扛著一邊走，在風中自由搖擺扭轉，更能具體瞭解到幡的用途。幡尾和幡腳上貼著小菱形碎箔，幡本身畫著紅色類似文字一樣的图形，但都無法識別。</p><p>菩薩與其後跟隨的貴婦人，乘在外部有淺色暈染的雲彩上，都是斜的姿勢。菩薩上半身扭轉，臉稍向婦人，不像上圖的菩薩完全回頭看背後的婦人。婦人（參照圖10－3）的任何方面都使人感到是很富有、地位高的人物。她昂著頭，腰板挺直，與上一圖的婦人（參照圖9－3）似乎在受菩薩的保護和引導，低頭行進的嫺靜姿態形成鮮明對比。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 11-1"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.51</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="san">Representations of Famous Buddhist Images (detail)</title><title lang="chi-Hant">釋迦瑞像圖</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 7th-8th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on silk</p><p>Dimensions of detail shown: H. 58.5 cm, W.44.0 cm</p><p>Original painting: H. about 310.0 cm, W. about 200.0cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting51、58. Ch. xxii. 0023</p><p>See also Figs. 9a-f</p><p>This painting, as related in the Introduction to Vol. 1, has for over fifty years been divided between the British Museum and the National Museum of India. It is among the most important of all those in the collection, since it is an example of the kind of record brought back from India by travelling monks, showing the most famous images of Buddhism. This is not to say that this painting was itself painted there - rather it is a composite picture bringing together many images from different places. Many of them, in fact, have associations with Khotan, and even with Gansu, rather than with India directly. Nor is the painting alone in providing such a repertoire of images from India and Khotan: Pelliot’s photographs, published in 1931, show similar collections of famous images as part of the ceiling decoration in Caves 231 and 237, and on a whole wall in Cave 220 (Grottes, Pls. CLXⅧ,CLXXⅥ,CⅪ). In Cave 231 there are thirty-five figures on the four sloping faces of the ceiling over the main niche, each figure with an inscription which has been recorded by Xie Zhiliu 謝稚柳 (Dunhuang yishu xulu 敦煌藝術敘錄,pp. 103-05). Some thirty-five figures are also visible in Pelliot’s Pl. CⅪ, showing the south wall of Cave 220 as it was at the time of his visit. Unfortunately the inscriptions were not recorded by Xie Zhiliu.</p><p>In the early 1940s this cave was found to have splendid and well-preserved paintings of the early Tang under these thirty-five figures which dated from the Five Dynasties. The later paintings were sacrificed to reveal the early Tang compositions beneath them. Pelliot’s photograph (also Lo Archive, no. 220-7), therefore, is all that remains as a record of them.</p><p>Like the lost wall painting of Cave 220, the silk painting originally had rows of images one above another. Its present divided state and the severe damage and losses it has sustained make it a difficult painting to assess, and these difficulties have led to its inclusion in the present volume, rather than in the first volume where by its probable date it should properly belong.</p><p>A consideration of the physical state of the painting may help in forming some idea of its original appearance. In the first place it is necessary to understand that the mounting (at the time of writing) of the British Museum portion is totally misleading. Professor Alexander Soper’s excellent article “Representations of Famous Images at Tun-huang” (1964-65, pp. 349-64) shows this mounting in his Fig. 2, and the New Delhi portion in Fig. 1. Only Pl. LXX in Serindia shows the largest British Museum fragment in its correct relation above the New Delhi portion. For this reason it has seemed best, in the monochrome plates to this volume, to present the British Museum fragments separately, and to add a drawing which shows how several smaller misplaced fragments should be arranged (Fig. 9d). As this volume goes to press, remounting of the fragments is in progress. A more comprehensive reconstruction and study of the whole painting must await an opportunity of seeing the New Delhi portion and the possible identification of further fragments. For the present a brief description must suffice.</p><p>The whole painting consisted of four rows of images, here referred to as A, B, C and D, the figures executed in outline but with a certain amount of ink shading and colour ornamentation. Cartouches of various shapes and sizes were fitted in as the seated or standing figures they described would allow. The largest British Museum fragment from the top of the painting (Fig. 9a) also has a very small piece of purple silk border, which defines the left edge of the painting. The fragment shown in Pl. 11 similarly similarly shows traces of the right-hand border, and may also come from the top of the painting. If it does, then the painting was originally made up of approximately three and a half widths of silk, the seams being indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 9d. No seam is present in Pl. 11, so there must have been a complete width of silk at the right edge of the painting.</p><p>Below, the principal fragment assigned to New Delhi (Stein, Thousand Buddhas, Pl. ⅪⅤ) consists of three rows of images, principally in their correct relation to one another, except for some very small fragments and one seated figure which has been moved from row C to row B. Its present place in row Brightly belongs to the fragments shown in Fig. 9b. They too show that most of the right-hand side of the painting is still missing. Finally, one large fragment in the British Museum (Fig. 9f), until now mounted upside down, has, as already described in Serindia, part of a female donor in seventh to eighth century dress next to the ruled space for a dedicatory inscription. The most likely position for this inscription which surely had a male donor on the other side and possibly other subsidiary donors as well, is at the bottom, immediately below the four rows of images. I have assumed this in suggesting the possible original size of the painting as about 3m by 2m; thus it can be seen that in size as well this was one of the most important paintings discovered by Stein. It has to be hoped that examination of any further fragments will help to complete the reconstruction.</p><p>We should now turn to the individual figures shown in the British 9a (and the drawing Fig. 9d) shows, first of all, two standing Buddhas, each with a canopy. Though fragmentary, enough can be made out of the two figures to determine that one is in vitarka - mudra; the other grasps the hem of the robe with his left hand while the right hand is lost. But no explanation has been offered, though dunhuang Cave 237 likewise has “two Buddhas side by side”. Separated from the two Buddhas by a tall narrow cartouche (no longer legible) is a large figure of a Buddha in a red robe, seated with legs pendent, under a larger canopy. Again, no explanation can be offered to identify this figure. To the right again, there appears a pair of men holding a ladder and gazing upwards at a missing image. A tiny fragment of bare feet on the other side of the images is all that remains of the rest, but the ladder is a distinctive clue to a story of a thief who wished to steal the jewel from the forehead of an image; although in longer accounts the ladder was never quite long enough, “all accounts agree that eventually the statue bent over out of pity to offer the jewel” (Soper, 1964-64, p. 363).</p><p>The next fragment, at the right end of the top row, is that shown in colour (Pl. 11), depicting first of all a garlanded Bodhisattva, with a double row of Buddhas in his aureole, and then a standing Buddha with his arm raised and supporting the sun, in which is seen a phoenix. Soper has connected this with the “image shown pointing to the sun and moon” found in three of the caves, perhaps Sakyamuni after the defeat of Mara.</p><p>This completes the first row of figures. The second row, B, begins at the left in the New Delhi portion with Gautama at the time of his illumination at Bodh Gaya. Next, also in India, is a standing figure, the aureole filled with busts of Buddhas, representing the miraculous multiplication of Buddha-bodies by Sakyamuni at Sravasti. Third in row B is the seated figure shown in Fig. 9b, with legs pendent and multiple figures in the aureole, with a top segment of musicians. Next to it is the lower half of a standing Buddha in a red robe. Nothing remains to identify it, nor can any other fragments be placed with certainty in this row.</p><p>The New Delhi portion continues in row C, first with four smaller figures, then a Buddha seated on a dragon throne, followed by a standing image identified by the small deer at the top (and by a cartouche preserved separately at the British Museum) as the “Image in the Deer Park in the country of Varanasi in middle India”. Similar inscriptions are to be found in Caves 231 and 237 at Dunhuang. After this should come the seated image at present mounted in the row above in New Delhi, with crescent moons in the nimbus, with next to it a small fragment, two men in coats and top-boots, wrongly mounted in the British Museum next to the ladder scene.</p><p>Row D is also in the New Delhi portion. It features standing figures in rocky settings: Avalokitesvara on Mt. Potalaka and Sakyamuni preaching at the Vulture Peak. The inscription and donor figures probably came below this, as row E.</p><p>In this way all of the British Museum fragments have been accounted for, except for two Lokapalas standing side by side, of which only a very narrow fragment showing a hand grasping a trident and another hand holding up a stupa (Fig. 9c) remain. There is also a separate tiny fragment of a pennant. There is of course no way at present to determine the original position of these fragments, other than that, as the left side and centre of the painting are virtually intact, they must be from the missing right side. If further fragments from the painting prove to be identifiable, it may be possible to reconstruct parts of this side as well. What can be seen at present already shows that the composition was presented in an orderly fashion: at least three of the figures in row A have canopies, while the figure holding the sun in Pl. 11 also appears appropriate to the top of the painting; at the bottom, Avalokitesvara and Sakyamuni are in substantial rocky settings that give stability to the whole. One would expect this lowest row, D, to have one more figure in a rocky setting. Moreover, in rows B and C there is already a certain measure of symmetry, seen in the regular alternation of seated and standing figures, giving five large scenes originally in each row. One is left with the feeling that this was a well-ordered and monumental composition, not just a lining-up of images in random order.</p><p>Several interesting points emerge when we consider the style of these fragments and their iconographical origins. For the latter the reader will have to refer to Professor Soper’s article, already mentioned above. Here it must suffice to say that while some of the figures show images famous in India, others have strong associations with Khotan. Similarly, while the drapery of the figures shows close affinities with the art of Gandhara (and many details of the jewellery can be traced to Indian or Gandharan prototypes also), still other details seem to have been borrowed from earlier Chinese Buddhist art, such as the celestial musicans, following Northern Wei, surrounding one of the New Delhi figures: Soper, noting this, has shown that “the images shown were not intended to be exclusively Indian at all, and were in fact faithfully recorded” (Soper, 1964-65, p. 352).</p><p>Looking at the elegant outline drawing of the figures, we can see that it is chiefly dependent on a subtle continuous line, not greatly modulated. The canopies of the three first figures in row A can be compared with canopies of the early Tang at Dunhuang, a domed form with curving ribs recurved at ends. From these hang small bells, with a little shading or highlight and a tongue hanging beneath each. In later paintings from Dunhuang these “tells” lengthen and take the form of tassels with horizontal coloured bands. Other eighth century stylistic characteristics can be seen in the facial delineation of the figures, especially of the mouth, comparable to those of the figures in Buddha Preaching the Law (Vol. 1, Pl. 7); or in the way in which the petals of the lotus thrones are strongly modeled and in some cases elaborately decorated with small leaf sprays in red.</p><p>Thus, in these severely damaged fragments, there is still a monument of outstanding importance and of early date, which can furnish much information on the lost images, not only of the similar painting once in Cave 220, but of Khotan, once a leading centre of Mahayana Buddhism, and of India, the land of its birth.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，7～8世紀</p><p>絹本設色</p><p>圖版部分的尺寸：高58.5釐米 寬44.0釐米</p><p>復原的預想尺寸：高約310.0釐米 寬約200.0釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫51、58.Ch.xxii.0023</p><p>參照Figs.9 a-f</p><p>正如第1卷的序文中提到的，此畫的所有斷片在50年前，大英博物館和新德里國立博物館間分割斯坦因收集品的時，被分藏到兩個博物館。此畫的一部分斷片也在聖彼得堡艾爾米塔什美術館裏发现。此作品是雲遊僧從印度帶回的佛教著名瑞像的一個例證，是斯坦因收集的敦煌畫中最爲珍貴的作品之一。此畫本身并不產生於印度，可能是採納了各地佛像样式的複合式作品，多数像與其說與印度有联系，不如看作是與和闐以及中國甘肅地區有直接關係。這不是唯一採納印度或和闐的各種佛像樣式而製作的範例，在1931年出版的伯希和《石窟圖錄》中，有第231窟和237窟天井畫的部分和第220窟的整壁畫上描繪的相同的瑞像圖（參照《石窟圖錄》圖版168、176、111）。據謝稚柳的記述，第231窟西壁佛龕的龕頂四周描有三十五身像，每一像都附有文字（參照《敦煌藝術敘錄》103～105頁）。同樣的三十五身像，在伯希和訪問的當時第220窟南壁的照片（《石窟圖錄》圖版111）中也可見到，但遺憾的是，謝稚柳沒有記錄有關文字。</p><p>1940年初，發現第220窟的下層留有華麗的初唐淨土圖，在剝落了上層的五代以後的壁畫的同時，南壁的瑞像圖也被破壞了。所以，現在與那瑞像圖有關的資料，除了伯希和和羅寄梅（參照No.220－7）的照片外，沒有留下其他資料。</p><p>與現已不存的第220窟壁畫的瑞像圖一樣，當初此絹繪的尊像也是由幾段重疊而成的。現在作品被分割成幾件的同時，損傷以及殘缺嚴重，對此畫的評價變得更難。這些困難，使得根據年代排列，它應屬本全集的第1卷組，卻被放到了現在的位置。</p><p>觀察各斷片的物理形狀，是獲取此畫結構原形的重要參考依據。首先，關於大英博物館收藏的部分，必須知道現在（撰寫該稿的時間）的裝裱是完全錯誤的。Alexander Soper教授的《敦煌瑞像圖》中將這錯誤的裝裱作爲了插圖2，與插圖1的新德里國立博物館收藏的部分一同刊載。而《西域》圖版70中，是把大英博物館最大的斷片放在新德里國立博物館收藏部分的上面，正確顯示出了它的位置關係。根據以上的分析，本卷Fig.9中，將大英博物館收藏的各斷片從現在的裝裱剝離，分開收錄的同時，還附帶列出了將錯誤部分糾正過來的勾勒圖。至於更廣範圍的復原以及對整圖的研究，不得不等見到新德里國立博物館收藏的諸斷片的實物，再與艾爾米塔什美術館收藏的斷片进行比較以后，目前只能記錄其概略。</p><p>畫面由下頁插圖中所標的ABCD四塊組成，諸像有墨線的輪廓，僅加墨暈和彩色。並且對應坐像和立像的不同而産生的空間變化，插入的長方形題記欄的形式和尺寸也適當改變。大英博物館收藏的最大斷片（參照Fig.9a）中，上端只留下很小的紫色絹邊，從而推定了當時構成了畫面左上部。同樣，圖11的斷片中也看到右端的絹邊痕迹，推斷當時處於畫面右上部位置。如果這種推斷是正確的，那麽當時畫面的幅寬是連接了三幅半絹子而成的寬幅作品，絹子可能是在Fig.9d中用點線標識的位置上縫合的。另外，圖11的斷片中看不出綴接的針眼，所以畫面的右側使用了一幅絹子。</p><p>從下方B到D的三塊中，出現的是新德里國立博物館收藏的此畫主要部分（參照《千佛洞》圖版14：下一頁的插圖）的諸尊。新德里國立博物館現在的裝裱中所見的諸尊位置關係大致準確，但極小的若干斷片和本來應屬C塊的一身坐像被移到了B塊中，現在那像的位置上，應放置Fig.9b所表現的大英博物館的斷片。如此整理，可知構成畫面右方的大部分斷片已遺失。然而引人注意的是，在上下顛倒裝裱的大英博物館收藏的大斷片（Fig.9f圖）中，正如在《西域》中指出的，功德題記欄的旁邊，可見一部分身著7～8世紀衣裳的女供養人像。作爲放置這題記欄的最合適位置的第四塊尊像群的正下方，即畫面的最下端，女供養人像的對面畫有男供養人像，他們各自的背後可能還跟隨著很多供養人。如此可見，當時此畫的尺寸可達到高3米、寬2米。從大小這一點上，也可以說它是斯坦因攜回的敦煌繪畫中最值得重視的作品之一。通過若干斷片類別的觀察，有望完成該繪畫的復原工作。</p><p>這裏再次回到大英博物館的斷片，想對錯誤裝裱的每個像進行推斷，並排出其正確的位置。最初在Fig.9a中揭示的斷片（其勾勒是9d圖），左端顯現華蓋下面並排站立的兩身佛，殘損嚴重，能確認其中一身結說法印，另一身的右手殘缺，左手抓衣端，沒有說明文，但和敦煌第237窟所見的“二佛並立”同趣。這兩佛像間用長方形題箋（字迹暗淡，無法釋讀）隔開的右側，可見大型華蓋下面著紅色衣服的倚像，此像也未留任何能比定的說明。再右側，有撐梯子的兩個男人，他們仰望上部描繪已遺失的佛像。相當於此部分的內容，應來自佛像對面，除了畫有裸足的小斷片外，任何也沒有留下，但梯子提供有力的線索，可知畫在這裏的是小偷盜竊佛像額頭上的寶石的故事。故事中講，佛像過大而梯子無法靠近，而“結局是佛像生憐憫心，俯首讓寶石取下”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》363頁）。</p><p>接下來是在圖11中刊载的斷片，當時它應在畫面最上段的右邊。左側是配飾兩層化佛背光，頸上懸挂花綵的菩薩。右側繪有舉右手捧日輪的佛立像，日輪中有鳳凰。Soper教授將其解釋爲在敦煌三個窟所見的，可能是表現釋迦降魔後的“指日月像”。</p><p>以上第一塊（A塊）結束，轉到第二塊（B塊）。左端是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現的是佛陀在菩提迦耶成道。其右邊也是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現舍衛城大神變，是背光裏繪入很多佛像的釋迦立像。接著它的第三個像是在Fig.9b中所揭示的倚像，背光內有很多佛頭，背光外插入飛天。其右方可見赤衣佛立像的下半身，但找不到放置此塊的位置或綴接它的其他斷片類。</p><p>新德里國立博物館的斷片也是接續C塊，最初是四身小像，次是坐在龍座上的佛陀。連接右邊的立像，從上方所描繪的小鹿和大英博物館分藏的這部分的長方形題簽所記的說明判斷，是中印度靠近波羅奈斯的鹿野苑初轉法輪像。在敦煌第231窟和第237窟的壁畫中也見到同樣的記述。此像的下面，是新德里國立博物館現在裝裱的上段位置，有頭光配飾三日月的坐像，大英博物館所藏現在錯誤粘貼在梯子部分右側的，只認出兩個人物的裳裾和長靴的斷片，應該是来自此像的右側。</p><p>D塊還在新德里國立博物館，是以岩山做背景的立像斷片，那是描繪補陀洛山的觀音和在靈鷲山說法的釋迦。其下即E段，可能是題記欄和供養人像。</p><p>以上只是涉及大英博物館的斷片類的大致解釋，另外，還有兩身並立的天王像，各自殘留只可辨認出一隻手、三叉戟、塔的一部分的極小的斷片（參照Fig.9c），現在無法確認當時這些斷片的正確位置，對畫面左邊部分和中央部分的敍述已經大體接近，因此只能認爲它們是殘缺嚴重的右邊部分的，如能發現證明該繪畫的斷片，才有可能復原這部分。</p><p>在此，整理總結迄今發現的有關構圖，目前的狀況是，A塊中，有華蓋的尊像至少能確認三身，圖11中捧日輪的佛可能也是畫面上端A塊的內容。另外，D塊中觀音和釋迦的描繪以堅固的岩山爲背景，給予了整體構圖的穩定感。此塊中可能還有一身以岩山爲背景的像。再，B以及C塊中，當時是坐像和立像交錯排列的五身像，而且可能也是接近左右對稱的結構。總之，該作品給我們留下的印象是，不只是尊像的羅列，而且還是有秩序的進行記錄的。</p><p>如果對所見的這些斷片中各像的風格和圖像的原型進行考察，可接觸到很多有趣的問題。關於圖像的問題，可以參考上述Soper教授的論文。有幾身像顯示出印度著名像的形象，這裏只打算留意其餘的有很強和闐影響的像。同樣，相對於尊像衣紋的線條與犍陀羅藝術有很深聯繫（寶石和裝飾部分可辨出是印度或犍陀羅的影響）的其他部分，如新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片中，有繼承北魏風格的飛天，也有採納早期中國佛教美術的表現方式。Soper教授也注意到這一點，“這些諸像沒有試圖表現印度式繪法，而是有意對實物進行忠實的記錄”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》352頁）。</p><p>注意諸像優美的輪廓線，可發現連貫精致的勾勒線幾乎沒有大的晃動。A塊最初三身像的華蓋，實際可與敦煌初唐時期窟中殘留的支撐肋材末端翻翹成拱形的華蓋做比較。那些華蓋邊緣挂小的吊鍾形裝飾，稍加暈染和高光的同時，下方添加了舌狀的描繪。更晚期的敦煌畫中，這種“吊鍾形裝飾”變得很長，平行的色線成穗形。體現此畫8世紀作品的風格特色，其他還可舉出諸尊臉部的描繪。特別是嘴部，可與《樹下說法圖》（參照第1卷圖7）的諸像做比較。另外蓮華座的蓮瓣表現得非常結實，時而還加入紅色葉脈的華麗裝飾，可窺出此畫是早期的範例。</p><p>綜上所述，此作品儘管殘損極其嚴重，但對於曾經存在于敦煌第220窟的同趣的繪畫、保存於大乘佛教指導中心和闐以及佛教發祥地印度等地現在已經遺失的佛畫來說，這畫能使人窺到很多東西，从這一點上它是非常重要的遺物。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 11-2"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.58</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Representations of Famous Buddhist Images (detail)</title><title lang="chi-Hant">釋迦瑞像圖</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 7th-8th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on silk</p><p>Dimensions of detail shown: H. 58.5 cm, W.44.0 cm</p><p>Original painting: H. about 310.0 cm, W. about 200.0cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting51、58. Ch. xxii. 0023</p><p>See also Figs. 9a-f</p><p>This painting, as related in the Introduction to Vol. 1, has for over fifty years been divided between the British Museum and the National Museum of India. It is among the most important of all those in the collection, since it is an example of the kind of record brought back from India by travelling monks, showing the most famous images of Buddhism. This is not to say that this painting was itself painted there-rather it is a composite picture bringing together many images from different places. Many of them, in fact, have associations with Khotan, and even with Gansu, rather than with India directly. Nor is the painting alone in providing such a repertoire of images from India and Khotan: Pelliot’s photographs, published in 1931, show similar collections of famous images as part of the ceiling decoration in Caves 231 and 237, and on a whole wall in Cave 220 (Grottes, Pls. CLXⅧ,CLXXⅥ,CⅪ). In Cave 231 there are thirty-five figures on the four sloping faces of the ceiling over the main niche, each figure with an inscription which has been recorded by Xie Zhiliu 謝稚柳 (Dunhuang yishu xulu 敦煌藝術敘錄,pp. 103-05). Some thirty-five figures are also visible in Pelliot’s Pl. CⅪ, showing the south wall of Cave 220 as it was at the time of his visit. Unfortunately the inscriptions were not recorded by Xie Zhiliu.</p><p>In the early 1940s this cave was found to have splendid and well-preserved paintings of the early Tang under these thirty-five figures which dated from the Five Dynasties. The later paintings were sacrificed to reveal the early Tang compositions beneath them. Pelliot’s photograph (also Lo Archive, no. 220-7), therefore, is all that remains as a record of them.</p><p>Like the lost wall painting of Cave 220, the silk painting originally had rows of images one above another. Its present divided state and the severe damage and losses it has sustained make it a difficult painting to assess, and these difficulties have led to its inclusion in the present volume, rather than in the first volume where by its probable date it should properly belong.</p><p>A consideration of the physical state of the painting may help in forming some idea of its original appearance. In the first place it is necessary to understand that the mounting (at the time of writing) of the British Museum portion is totally misleading. Professor Alexander Soper’s excellent article “Representations of Famous Images at Tun-huang” (1964-65, pp. 349-64) shows this mounting in his Fig. 2, and the New Delhi portion in Fig. 1. Only Pl. LXX in Serindia shows the largest British Museum fragment in its correct relation above the New Delhi portion. For this reason it has seemed best, in the monochrome plates to this volume, to present the British Museum fragments separately, and to add a drawing which shows how several smaller misplaced fragments should be arranged (Fig. 9d). As this volume goes to press, remounting of the fragments is in progress. A more comprehensive reconstruction and study of the whole painting must await an opportunity of seeing the New Delhi portion and the possible identification of further fragments. For the present a brief description must suffice.</p><p>The whole painting consisted of four rows of images, here referred to as A, B, C and D, the figures executed in outline but with a certain amount of ink shading and colour ornamentation. Cartouches of various shapes and sizes were fitted in as the seated or standing figures they described would allow. The largest British Museum fragment from the top of the painting (Fig. 9a) also has a very small piece of purple silk border, which defines the left edge of the painting. The fragment shown in Pl. 11 similarly similarly shows traces of the right-hand border, and may also come from the top of the painting. If it does, then the painting was originally made up of approximately three and a half widths of silk, the seams being indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 9d. No seam is present in Pl. 11, so there must have been a complete width of silk at the right edge of the painting.</p><p>Below, the principal fragment assigned to New Delhi (Stein, Thousand Buddhas, Pl. ⅪⅤ) consists of three rows of images, principally in their correct relation to one another, except for some very small fragments and one seated figure which has been moved from row C to row B. Its present place in row Brightly belongs to the fragments shown in Fig. 9b. They too show that most of the right-hand side of the painting is still missing. Finally, one large fragment in the British Museum (Fig. 9f), until now mounted upside down, has, as already described in Serindia, part of a female donor in seventh to eighth century dress next to the ruled space for a dedicatory inscription. The most likely position for this inscription which surely had a male donor on the other side and possibly other subsidiary donors as well, is at the bottom, immediately below the four rows of images. I have assumed this in suggesting the possible original size of the painting as about 3m by 2m; thus it can be seen that in size as well this was one of the most important paintings discovered by Stein. It has to be hoped that examination of any further fragments will help to complete the reconstruction.</p><p>We should now turn to the individual figures shown in the British 9a (and the drawing Fig. 9d) shows, first of all, two standing Buddhas, each with a canopy. Though fragmentary, enough can be made out of the two figures to determine that one is in vitarka - mudra; the other grasps the hem of the robe with his left hand while the right hand is lost. But no explanation has been offered, though dunhuang Cave 237 likewise has “two Buddhas side by side”. Separated from the two Buddhas by a tall narrow cartouche (no longer legible) is a large figure of a Buddha in a red robe, seated with legs pendent, under a larger canopy. Again, no explanation can be offered to identify this figure. To the right again, there appears a pair of men holding a ladder and gazing upwards at a missing image. A tiny fragment of bare feet on the other side of the images is all that remains of the rest, but the ladder is a distinctive clue to a story of a thief who wished to steal the jewel from the forehead of an image; although in longer accounts the ladder was never quite long enough, “all accounts agree that eventually the statue bent over out of pity to offer the jewel” (Soper, 1964-64, p. 363).</p><p>The next fragment, at the right end of the top row, is that shown in colour (Pl. 11), depicting first of all a garlanded Bodhisattva, with a double row of Buddhas in his aureole, and then a standing Buddha with his arm raised and supporting the sun, in which is seen a phoenix. Soper has connected this with the “image shown pointing to the sun and moon” found in three of the caves, perhaps Sakyamuni after the defeat of Mara.</p><p>This completes the first row of figures. The second row, B, begins at the left in the New Delhi portion with Gautama at the time of his illumination at Bodh Gaya. Next, also in India, is a standing figure, the aureole filled with busts of Buddhas, representing the miraculous multiplication of Buddha-bodies by Sakyamuni at Sravasti. Third in row B is the seated figure shown in Fig. 9b, with legs pendent and multiple figures in the aureole, with a top segment of musicians. Next to it is the lower half of a standing Buddha in a red robe. Nothing remains to identify it, nor can any other fragments be placed with certainty in this row.</p><p>The New Delhi portion continues in row C, first with four smaller figures, then a Buddha seated on a dragon throne, followed by a standing image identified by the small deer at the top (and by a cartouche preserved separately at the British Museum) as the “Image in the Deer Park in the country of Varanasi in middle India”. Similar inscriptions are to be found in Caves 231 and 237 at Dunhuang. After this should come the seated image at present mounted in the row above in New Delhi, with crescent moons in the nimbus, with next to it a small fragment, two men in coats and top-boots, wrongly mounted in the British Museum next to the ladder scene.</p><p>Row D is also in the New Delhi portion. It features standing figures in rocky settings: Avalokitesvara on Mt. Potalaka and Sakyamuni preaching at the Vulture Peak. The inscription and donor figures probably came below this, as row E.</p><p>In this way all of the British Museum fragments have been accounted for, except for two Lokapalas standing side by side, of which only a very narrow fragment showing a hand grasping a trident and another hand holding up a stupa (Fig. 9c) remain. There is also a separate tiny fragment of a pennant. There is of course no way at present to determine the original position of these fragments, other than that, as the left side and centre of the painting are virtually intact, they must be from the missing right side. If further fragments from the painting prove to be identifiable, it may be possible to reconstruct parts of this side as well. What can be seen at present already shows that the composition was presented in an orderly fashion: at least three of the figures in row A have canopies, while the figure holding the sun in Pl. 11 also appears appropriate to the top of the painting; at the bottom, Avalokitesvara and Sakyamuni are in substantial rocky settings that give stability to the whole. One would expect this lowest row, D, to have one more figure in a rocky setting. Moreover, in rows B and C there is already a certain measure of symmetry, seen in the regular alternation of seated and standing figures, giving five large scenes originally in each row. One is left with the feeling that this was a well-ordered and monumental composition, not just a lining-up of images in random order.</p><p>Several interesting points emerge when we consider the style of these fragments and their iconographical origins. For the latter the reader will have to refer to Professor Soper’s article, already mentioned above. Here it must suffice to say that while some of the figures show images famous in India, others have strong associations with Khotan. Similarly, while the drapery of the figures shows close affinities with the art of Gandhara (and many details of the jewellery can be traced to Indian or Gandharan prototypes also), still other details seem to have been borrowed from earlier Chinese Buddhist art, such as the celestial musicans, following Northern Wei, surrounding one of the New Delhi figures: Soper, noting this, has shown that “the images shown were not intended to be exclusively Indian at all, and were in fact faithfully recorded” (Soper, 1964-65, p. 352).</p><p>Looking at the elegant outline drawing of the figures, we can see that it is chiefly dependent on a subtle continuous line, not greatly modulated. The canopies of the three first figures in row A can be compared with canopies of the early Tang at Dunhuang, a domed form with curving ribs recurved at ends. From these hang small bells, with a little shading or highlight and a tongue hanging beneath each. In later paintings from Dunhuang these “tells” lengthen and take the form of tassels with horizontal coloured bands. Other eighth century stylistic characteristics can be seen in the facial delineation of the figures, especially of the mouth, comparable to those of the figures in Buddha Preaching the Law (Vol. 1, Pl. 7); or in the way in which the petals of the lotus thrones are strongly modeled and in some cases elaborately decorated with small leaf sprays in red.</p><p>Thus, in these severely damaged fragments, there is still a monument of outstanding importance and of early date, which can furnish much information on the lost images, not only of the similar painting once in Cave 220, but of Khotan, once a leading centre of Mahayana Buddhism, and of India, the land of its birth.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，7～8世紀</p><p>絹本設色</p><p>圖版部分的尺寸：高58.5釐米 寬44.0釐米</p><p>復原的預想尺寸：高約310.0釐米 寬約200.0釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫51、58.Ch.xxii.0023</p><p>參照Figs.9 a-f</p><p>正如第1卷的序文中提到的，此畫的所有斷片在50年前，大英博物館和新德里國立博物館間分割斯坦因收集品的時，被分藏到兩個博物館。此畫的一部分斷片也在聖彼得堡艾爾米塔什美術館裏发现。此作品是雲遊僧從印度帶回的佛教著名瑞像的一個例證，是斯坦因收集的敦煌畫中最爲珍貴的作品之一。此畫本身并不產生於印度，可能是採納了各地佛像样式的複合式作品，多数像與其說與印度有联系，不如看作是與和闐以及中國甘肅地區有直接關係。這不是唯一採納印度或和闐的各種佛像樣式而製作的範例，在1931年出版的伯希和《石窟圖錄》中，有第231窟和237窟天井畫的部分和第220窟的整壁畫上描繪的相同的瑞像圖（參照《石窟圖錄》圖版168、176、111）。據謝稚柳的記述，第231窟西壁佛龕的龕頂四周描有三十五身像，每一像都附有文字（參照《敦煌藝術敘錄》103～105頁）。同樣的三十五身像，在伯希和訪問的當時第220窟南壁的照片（《石窟圖錄》圖版111）中也可見到，但遺憾的是，謝稚柳沒有記錄有關文字。</p><p>1940年初，發現第220窟的下層留有華麗的初唐淨土圖，在剝落了上層的五代以後的壁畫的同時，南壁的瑞像圖也被破壞了。所以，現在與那瑞像圖有關的資料，除了伯希和和羅寄梅（參照No.220－7）的照片外，沒有留下其他資料。</p><p>與現已不存的第220窟壁畫的瑞像圖一樣，當初此絹繪的尊像也是由幾段重疊而成的。現在作品被分割成幾件的同時，損傷以及殘缺嚴重，對此畫的評價變得更難。這些困難，使得根據年代排列，它應屬本全集的第1卷組，卻被放到了現在的位置。</p><p>觀察各斷片的物理形狀，是獲取此畫結構原形的重要參考依據。首先，關於大英博物館收藏的部分，必須知道現在（撰寫該稿的時間）的裝裱是完全錯誤的。Alexander Soper教授的《敦煌瑞像圖》中將這錯誤的裝裱作爲了插圖2，與插圖1的新德里國立博物館收藏的部分一同刊載。而《西域》圖版70中，是把大英博物館最大的斷片放在新德里國立博物館收藏部分的上面，正確顯示出了它的位置關係。根據以上的分析，本卷Fig.9中，將大英博物館收藏的各斷片從現在的裝裱剝離，分開收錄的同時，還附帶列出了將錯誤部分糾正過來的勾勒圖。至於更廣範圍的復原以及對整圖的研究，不得不等見到新德里國立博物館收藏的諸斷片的實物，再與艾爾米塔什美術館收藏的斷片进行比較以后，目前只能記錄其概略。</p><p>畫面由下頁插圖中所標的ABCD四塊組成，諸像有墨線的輪廓，僅加墨暈和彩色。並且對應坐像和立像的不同而産生的空間變化，插入的長方形題記欄的形式和尺寸也適當改變。大英博物館收藏的最大斷片（參照Fig.9a）中，上端只留下很小的紫色絹邊，從而推定了當時構成了畫面左上部。同樣，圖11的斷片中也看到右端的絹邊痕迹，推斷當時處於畫面右上部位置。如果這種推斷是正確的，那麽當時畫面的幅寬是連接了三幅半絹子而成的寬幅作品，絹子可能是在Fig.9d中用點線標識的位置上縫合的。另外，圖11的斷片中看不出綴接的針眼，所以畫面的右側使用了一幅絹子。</p><p>從下方B到D的三塊中，出現的是新德里國立博物館收藏的此畫主要部分（參照《千佛洞》圖版14：下一頁的插圖）的諸尊。新德里國立博物館現在的裝裱中所見的諸尊位置關係大致準確，但極小的若干斷片和本來應屬C塊的一身坐像被移到了B塊中，現在那像的位置上，應放置Fig.9b所表現的大英博物館的斷片。如此整理，可知構成畫面右方的大部分斷片已遺失。然而引人注意的是，在上下顛倒裝裱的大英博物館收藏的大斷片（Fig.9f圖）中，正如在《西域》中指出的，功德題記欄的旁邊，可見一部分身著7～8世紀衣裳的女供養人像。作爲放置這題記欄的最合適位置的第四塊尊像群的正下方，即畫面的最下端，女供養人像的對面畫有男供養人像，他們各自的背後可能還跟隨著很多供養人。如此可見，當時此畫的尺寸可達到高3米、寬2米。從大小這一點上，也可以說它是斯坦因攜回的敦煌繪畫中最值得重視的作品之一。通過若干斷片類別的觀察，有望完成該繪畫的復原工作。</p><p>這裏再次回到大英博物館的斷片，想對錯誤裝裱的每個像進行推斷，並排出其正確的位置。最初在Fig.9a中揭示的斷片（其勾勒是9d圖），左端顯現華蓋下面並排站立的兩身佛，殘損嚴重，能確認其中一身結說法印，另一身的右手殘缺，左手抓衣端，沒有說明文，但和敦煌第237窟所見的“二佛並立”同趣。這兩佛像間用長方形題箋（字迹暗淡，無法釋讀）隔開的右側，可見大型華蓋下面著紅色衣服的倚像，此像也未留任何能比定的說明。再右側，有撐梯子的兩個男人，他們仰望上部描繪已遺失的佛像。相當於此部分的內容，應來自佛像對面，除了畫有裸足的小斷片外，任何也沒有留下，但梯子提供有力的線索，可知畫在這裏的是小偷盜竊佛像額頭上的寶石的故事。故事中講，佛像過大而梯子無法靠近，而“結局是佛像生憐憫心，俯首讓寶石取下”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》363頁）。</p><p>接下來是在圖11中刊载的斷片，當時它應在畫面最上段的右邊。左側是配飾兩層化佛背光，頸上懸挂花綵的菩薩。右側繪有舉右手捧日輪的佛立像，日輪中有鳳凰。Soper教授將其解釋爲在敦煌三個窟所見的，可能是表現釋迦降魔後的“指日月像”。</p><p>以上第一塊（A塊）結束，轉到第二塊（B塊）。左端是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現的是佛陀在菩提迦耶成道。其右邊也是新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片，表現舍衛城大神變，是背光裏繪入很多佛像的釋迦立像。接著它的第三個像是在Fig.9b中所揭示的倚像，背光內有很多佛頭，背光外插入飛天。其右方可見赤衣佛立像的下半身，但找不到放置此塊的位置或綴接它的其他斷片類。</p><p>新德里國立博物館的斷片也是接續C塊，最初是四身小像，次是坐在龍座上的佛陀。連接右邊的立像，從上方所描繪的小鹿和大英博物館分藏的這部分的長方形題簽所記的說明判斷，是中印度靠近波羅奈斯的鹿野苑初轉法輪像。在敦煌第231窟和第237窟的壁畫中也見到同樣的記述。此像的下面，是新德里國立博物館現在裝裱的上段位置，有頭光配飾三日月的坐像，大英博物館所藏現在錯誤粘貼在梯子部分右側的，只認出兩個人物的裳裾和長靴的斷片，應該是来自此像的右側。</p><p>D塊還在新德里國立博物館，是以岩山做背景的立像斷片，那是描繪補陀洛山的觀音和在靈鷲山說法的釋迦。其下即E段，可能是題記欄和供養人像。</p><p>以上只是涉及大英博物館的斷片類的大致解釋，另外，還有兩身並立的天王像，各自殘留只可辨認出一隻手、三叉戟、塔的一部分的極小的斷片（參照Fig.9c），現在無法確認當時這些斷片的正確位置，對畫面左邊部分和中央部分的敍述已經大體接近，因此只能認爲它們是殘缺嚴重的右邊部分的，如能發現證明該繪畫的斷片，才有可能復原這部分。</p><p>在此，整理總結迄今發現的有關構圖，目前的狀況是，A塊中，有華蓋的尊像至少能確認三身，圖11中捧日輪的佛可能也是畫面上端A塊的內容。另外，D塊中觀音和釋迦的描繪以堅固的岩山爲背景，給予了整體構圖的穩定感。此塊中可能還有一身以岩山爲背景的像。再，B以及C塊中，當時是坐像和立像交錯排列的五身像，而且可能也是接近左右對稱的結構。總之，該作品給我們留下的印象是，不只是尊像的羅列，而且還是有秩序的進行記錄的。</p><p>如果對所見的這些斷片中各像的風格和圖像的原型進行考察，可接觸到很多有趣的問題。關於圖像的問題，可以參考上述Soper教授的論文。有幾身像顯示出印度著名像的形象，這裏只打算留意其餘的有很強和闐影響的像。同樣，相對於尊像衣紋的線條與犍陀羅藝術有很深聯繫（寶石和裝飾部分可辨出是印度或犍陀羅的影響）的其他部分，如新德里國立博物館收藏的斷片中，有繼承北魏風格的飛天，也有採納早期中國佛教美術的表現方式。Soper教授也注意到這一點，“這些諸像沒有試圖表現印度式繪法，而是有意對實物進行忠實的記錄”（參照《敦煌瑞像圖》352頁）。</p><p>注意諸像優美的輪廓線，可發現連貫精致的勾勒線幾乎沒有大的晃動。A塊最初三身像的華蓋，實際可與敦煌初唐時期窟中殘留的支撐肋材末端翻翹成拱形的華蓋做比較。那些華蓋邊緣挂小的吊鍾形裝飾，稍加暈染和高光的同時，下方添加了舌狀的描繪。更晚期的敦煌畫中，這種“吊鍾形裝飾”變得很長，平行的色線成穗形。體現此畫8世紀作品的風格特色，其他還可舉出諸尊臉部的描繪。特別是嘴部，可與《樹下說法圖》（參照第1卷圖7）的諸像做比較。另外蓮華座的蓮瓣表現得非常結實，時而還加入紅色葉脈的華麗裝飾，可窺出此畫是早期的範例。</p><p>綜上所述，此作品儘管殘損極其嚴重，但對於曾經存在于敦煌第220窟的同趣的繪畫、保存於大乘佛教指導中心和闐以及佛教發祥地印度等地現在已經遺失的佛畫來說，這畫能使人窺到很多東西，从這一點上它是非常重要的遺物。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 12"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.11</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Paradise of Maitreya</title><title lang="chi-Hant">彌勒下生經變相圖</title><note lang="eng"><p>Late Tang or early Five Dynasties,late 9th –early 10th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on silk</p><p>H. 138.7 cm, W. 116.0 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting11. Ch. lviii. 001</p><p>See also Figs. 10-13</p><p>Both the Bodhisattva and the aristocratic figure behind him are supported on clouds, lightly silhouetted against pale colour shading. Both advance in three-quarter view, but the torso of the Bodhisattva is turned in a slight contrapposto to face the spectator, rather than being fully turned in a gesture to the lady behind as in Pl.9. The lady herself gives every impression of wealth and social standing (Pl. 10-3). Her stance is upright, in contrast to the downward glance and demure bearing that characterizes the lady of Pl.9-3, in harmony with the protective attitude of the Bodhisattva in that painting.</p><p>This impressive paradise painting is identified as that of Maitreya by the several texts from the Maitreya sutra inscribed in cartouches accompanying scenes at the top and bottom of the painting. Other examples of the subject have been listed by Terukaze Akiyama in his excellent article in Seiiki Bunka Kenkyu, Ⅵ.</p><p>The whole composition is much more densely packed than some of the comparable wall paintings and other examples of this subject to which Eiichi Matsumoto and Terukazu Akiyama have drawn attention. In the centre, the Buddha and his attendants form a compact group, the spaces between them almost completely filled by their decorated aureoles (Pl. 12-2). Behind them are the guardian kings Vaisravana, holding a trident-banner with black and white streamers, and Virupaksa, holding a sword, each accompanied by a Dharmapala. Smaller groups, each of a Buddha with two seated Bodhisattvas and a third standing behind, appear on either side. Even in these groups set diagonally there is a strong tendency for the painter to set his figures in the picture plane (Pl. 12-3). As a result the nimbi are again prominent and perfectly circular, and the figures are mainly seen from the front, with just the heads turned to attempt to show the relationships between them. Such an arrangement may be contrasted with the more accomplished groupings of similar triads in compositions of the ninth century, for example in the paradises of Bhaisajyaguru and Amitabha (Vol. 1, Pls. 10, 16).</p><p>Most distinctive, in this and other representations of Maitreya’s paradise, are the ordination scenes that appear here at the bottom of the painting (Pl. 12-6), together with a sumptuous array of gifts on two facing altar tables: bundles of scrolls or silk, tall water-sprinklers, a lobed silver dish, and baskets each containing six cakes, or mounds of sacred grain (Fig. 13). On the right a king and on the left a queen, each with a retinue of attendants, are seated as their heads are shaved. These two scenes are given added visual interest by the inclusion of a groom with three saddled horses, on the right, and a hexagonal kiosk with multi-coloured panels, on the left, between the two groups is a canopied throne with a number of figures busy about it.</p><p>As a counterpart to these scenes at the bottom of the painting, further narrative scenes appear at the top (Pl. 12-5), in a narrow space above a range of mountains and spiky trees stretching right across the painting at the level of the tops of the canopies of the main figures. These scenes too are found in other representations of Maitreya’s paradise, including a preparatory sketch on paper (Fig. 85) and many examples in wall paintings at Dunhuang and Wanfoxia. Among the latter, those on the west wall of Cave 25 of the Yulin caves (Warner, 1938, Pl. XXX), dating from the ninth century, are of particular beauty, and will be referred to again below.</p><p>In the present painting on silk, all these narrative scenes are accompanied by texts in cartouches. The texts themselves are taken from the Mile xiasheng jing, which contains anecdotes announcing the future birth of Maitreya as the son of the minister Brahmayu in the city of Ketumati under the reign of King Cakravarti-raja Sankha. For reasons that will become clear below, it is necessary to examine each of the scenes in turn, along with the accompanying text. All of the texts are quotations from Kumarajiva’s translation of the Maitreya sutra (Taisho Daizokyo, vol. 14, no. 454, pp. 423-25), but with constant errors on the part of the copyist; only those substitutions essential to the understanding of the text are given here. The translations are those given by Arthur Waley in his Catalogue.</p><p>Beginning from the top right, the first cartouche describes the peaceful conditions that will obtain when the future Buddha, Maitreya, is born:</p><p lang="chi-Hant">無有怨賊劫竊之患城邑聚樂(落)無開(閉)門者時</p><p lang="chi-Hant">尒時人民命中自然行誦(詣)椓(塚)間如死時生安樂</p><p>In those days the people of the land when their span of life is over, will go of their own accord to the tomb and die there. Peace and happiness will prevail. (In that country) there will be no fierce bandits nor thieves to fear. In none of the towns or villages will men shut their gates. (Taisho Daizokyo, vol. 14, p. 424a.)</p><p>The first line of this inscription is illustrated in another part of the painting, and we shall return to it later. Here in the top right corner the illustration shows three men seated at a long table, in a carpeted enclosure which is screened off by curtains. There are dishes on the table, though barely visible, and two attendants are bringing other dishes. In addition, a lady and a gentleman are seen in front of a large mirror on a stand. This last detail does not appear in the more detailed ninth century depiction of this scene in Cave 25 of the Yulin caves (Warner, 1938, Pl. XLI A; Lo Archive, no. 3020). The mirror, however, is a clue to other elements of the iconography which the painter was forced to omit because of lack of space. Cave 25 at Yulin, although it does not show a mirror, does show a group of women, and one man making a prostration, in the curtained space opposite the feasting scene. Terukazu Akiyama has noted a similar group of ladies making an offering in the sketches of the manuscript Stein 259 (Fig. 85), and has suggested that they may represent the daughter of King Cakravarti-raja Sankha, praising Maitreya. But the association of the group with a feast, in the manuscript and in the wall painting, suggests a simpler explanation. In Cave 12 at Dunhuang (Dunhuang bihua, Pl. 178), all the elements – feast scene, group of women, prostrated figure, mirror, and a standing man and woman-are seen along with gifts in boxes set out in the carpeted enclosure. The feast is evidently a wedding feast with the ladies grouped around the bride, and may illustrate the passage in the Mile xiasheng jing that reads: 女人年五百歲爾乃行嫁 “women will only marry when they reach the age of 500”,referring to the longevity of people in Maitreya’s land (see Chugoku Sekkutsu, Tonko Makkokutsu, vol. 3, note to Pl. 142). In every case, the painter’s intention was to show a scene of peace and happiness, and not the Way of Hungry Ghosts, as was originally suggested by Eiichi Matsumoto.</p><p lang="chi-Hant">神王不見其身如雨華香供養於佛三千大千世界時</p><p lang="chi-Hant">亦無衰惱水火刀兵及之居謹榮觀尒時之天龍</p><p>Moreover there will be no sorrows or cares, floods, fires, weapons, or men of war; nor shall any man suffer from hunger, poisoning, or other hurt. (Taisho Daizokyo, vol. 14, p.424a.)</p><p>Then all devas and holy dragons, without showing themselves, shall rain down flowers and perfumes, offering them to the Buddha. The three thousand million worlds...(Taisho Daizokyo, vol. 14, p. 424b.)</p><p>In the illustration, three men are seated at a table with money-bags on it. Lengths of cloth are draped over a stand at the back, and a vase is shown in front. This illustration does not seem to appear in Cave 25. The theme is clearly one of prosperity, continuing that of the first scene.</p><p>The third illustration is one that is familiar not only from all other representations of the Maitreya sutra, but from other secular sources as well, the best-known example being the painted bricks from tombs of the Wei and Jin dynasties at Jiayuguan in Gansu province, illustrating the fruitful activities in the life of the deceased (Han Tang bihua, Pl. 49), while another tomb dated A. D. 630 in Shaanxi province has the same scene almost exactly as seen here (ibid., Pl. 59).</p><p>The first line of the text can be read only with the help of the sutra text, and proves to follow on directly from the last quotation:</p><p lang="chi-Hant">國應可度者皆得見佛時</p><p lang="chi-Hant">尒時[皆大震動佛身出光照無量]</p><p>(The three thousand million worlds ) will all shake greatly. The light from Maitreya’s body shall shine upon limitless lands and all those that pass shall see Buddha. (Taisho Daizokyo, vol. 14, p. 424b.)</p><p>The painter has simply taken a theme already familiar in the context of Chinese pictorial art and used it with its connotations of agricultural production to continue the theme begun in the first scene. Although lack of space prevented their inclusion in this silk painting, in other illustrations of the Maitreya sutra, in Cave 25 at Yulin and elsewhere, the man ploughing with two oxen is set next to others threshing and winnowing, a motif also seen among the painted bricks of the third century from Jiayuguan (Han Tang bihua, Pl. 44) and familiar from such Han dynasty monuments as clay bricks from Sichuan. In the caption to this scene in Cave 61 at Dunhuang, the text (one phrase of which, 美味皆充足, is from Yijing’s translation of the sutra, Taisho Daizokyo, vol. 14, no.455, p.426a) is directly relevant to the picture, and still essentially has an optimistic tone: “When the Compassionate one is met with, foods will all be in plenty; (instead of) toiling and suffering to the point of exhaustion, ploughing and sowing will be no labour” (Dunhuang bihua, Pl. 201). Kumarajiva’s translation is even more to the point: “one sowing will yield seven-fold; with very little effort one will harvest a great deal” 一種七穫用功甚少所取甚多 (Taisho Daizokyo, vol. 14, no. 454, p. 424a).</p><p>The fourth cartouche adjoins the central courtyard scene:</p><p lang="chi-Hant">得免三惡世間無常命難救保時</p><p lang="chi-Hant">尒時人民各作是念壤佛千億</p><p>Then the people of the land shall make each of them this reflection: “Even if for a thousand million years I escape the Three Evil Ways, the world is impermanent and life cannot be preserved forever”. (Taisho Daizokyo, vol. 14, p. 424c.)</p><p>The illustration simply shows four men in a devout attitude. They are matched on the opposite side of the courtyard by a similar group of women; next to them is the fifth cartouche:</p><p lang="chi-Hant">純以金山(沙)覇地處皆有金銀之樶供養時</p><p lang="chi-Hant">尒時城邑舎宅及請利巷及至無有細微</p><p>(In the city of Ketumati, where Maitreya will be born) neither in (the gardens of ) any of the houses of the city nor in any of the outlying quarters or lanes will there be the least particle (of common earth), but all the ground will everywhere be covered with golden sand; and here and there will be heaps of silver and of gold. (Taisho Daizokyo, vol. 14,p. 424a.)</p><p>The image of precious things lying about is not seen here in the painting, perhaps because of lack of space. A detail in the left foreground, however, suggests that the phrase jinshan 金山 (golden rock, for 金沙, golden sand) was taken literally by the painter, for a large rock is seen lying on the ground, with a man passing by and pointing to it. His demeanour is somewhat similar to a figure in the Maitreya paradise in Cave 25 at Yulin, shown walking past symbols of wealth and treasure lying on the ground. Moreover the Yulin scene occurs in the same context, for immediately above in the wall painting is a much more beautifully rendered version of the scene that follows next in the silk painting: a man and a woman standing in front of an older couple seated in a beehive-shaped hut. In the wall painting there is only one occupant of the hut, a venerable old man with a snow-white beard and rustic twisted staff, seated in front of an elaborate three- fold landscape screen, apparently relaxed and cheerful as he gives his hand in farewell to his sorrowing wife and reverent family.</p><p>It is immediately apparent that the scene, both in the wall painting and in the Stein painting on silk, illustrates the first line of the first cartouche in the top right corner of the painting: “In those days the people of the land when their span of life is over, will go of their own accord to the tomb and die there”. Another possible interpretation of this scene is suggested both by the sutra and by the shape of the hut. This is just like the meditation cells often depicted at Dunhuang (see Vol. 1, Pl. 19-3, top left). The sutra says that in Maitreya’s time many people will take up the religious life and meditate. A third explanation, that these are the parents of Maitreya, does not account for the cell-like structure of the hut, or the evident grief seen in the Yulin painting.</p><p>The last cartouche at the top of the painting is on the far left and reads:</p><p lang="chi-Hant">□□□無量變現釋提恒國(因)供養時</p><p lang="chi-Hant">□□□衆供敬從佛入翅頭末城當人</p><p lang="chi-Hant">□□既転法輸度天巳將諸弟子入城</p><p>When (Maitreya) has finished turning the Wheel of the Law and has saved both devas and men he will go with all his disciples into the town. Innumerable devas reverencing and worshipping the Buddha will follow him into the city of ketumati. When they are inside (they will perform) innumerable miracles and Sakra, Lord of Devas, will make offering ... (Taisho Daizokyo, vol. 14, p. 425b.)</p><p>The accompanying illustration appears in a rather condensed form, due to lack of space. In Cave 25 the same motifs, the town of Ketumati, the Buddha with his attendants receiving an offering from a kneeling dignitary, a demon sweeping outside the walls of the city, and a dragon appearing in the sky, appear in more spacious fashion also in an upper corner, but reversed and on the right. All of them have been identified by Langdon Warner with passages in the sutra.</p><p>The scenes at the bottom of the painting are more immediately recognizable in relation to the cartouches and to the Maitreya sutra, since they deal with specific events that were more easily portrayed than the generalized descriptions of prosperity from the top. Moreover, they are elements with a measure of symmetry, always prized by Chinese painters, and particularly in the context of a paradise painting.</p><p lang="chi-Hant">家學道亦復有八萬四千至婆羅門供養時</p><p lang="chi-Hant">尒時蠰佉王亦供八萬四千大乘供敬遶□出</p><p>Then shall the king Sankha also leave his home and study the way in company with his 84,000 great ministers who respectfully surround him; and again 84,000 excellent Brahmins ... (Taisho Daizokyo, vol. 14, p.424c.)</p><p>The accompanying illustration is more prominent in this painting on silk than in the wall paintings, where the shaving scenes appear nearer the centre of the composition. The horses that appear in the corner are of interest. They add considerably to the impression of importance in the retinue attending the king, but they do not appear in the wall paintings. The one horse that does appear in Cave 25 is immediately next to this group, but is in fact one of the Seven Treasures of the Cakravartin (see Vol. 1, Pl. 40). The artist of the Stein painting has simply secularized the motif and repeated it to enlarge the initiation group, with considerable success.</p><p>The next cartouche, a green one, between the table laden with offerings and vessels and the central canopied throne, reads:</p><p lang="chi-Hant">中亦共出家造塔供養時</p><p lang="chi-Hant">尒時婆羅門聚明大知於佛法</p><p>Then Brahmins intelligent and enlightened, very learned in Buddha’s law, shall leave their homes and build a stupa, dedicating it ... (Taisho Daizokyo, vol. 14, p. 424c.)</p><p>The words 造塔 (build a stupa) are not in the sutra text, and Waley has already pointed out that the scene itself must refer not to the building of a stupa but to the dismantling of the king’s jeweled throne, given as a present to Maitreya, and that the Brahmins, in the Khotanese version of the story, were skilled not “in Buddha’s Law”, but “in the study of the Vedas”. The dismantling operation is much clearer in the wall paintings of Cave 25, where a two-storeyed pavilion is shown with the roof off.</p><p>The next cartouche, in front of the same scene, is not illustrated:</p><p lang="chi-Hant">根智惠金鬱名羅是與六萬人時</p><p lang="chi-Hant">尒時族婆羅門子名須摩提利</p><p>Then a Brahmin’s son named Sumati, a relation of Maitreya, of acute penetration and intelligence who is the same that in this incarnation is called Uttara with 60,000 others ...

(Taisho Daizokyo, vol. 14, p. 424c.)</p><p>Again, there is no room for specific illustration. The last cartouche brings us to the scene of the shaving of the queen:</p><p lang="chi-Hant">提婆郍(那？)是亦與八萬四千人俱供出家彌勒佛謁時</p><p lang="chi-Hant">八萬四千綵女俱供出家蠰佉王太子名曰天色今</p><p lang="chi-Hant">尒時蠰佉王寶女名舎彌婆帝金之毗舎供佉是亦與</p><p>The king Sankha shall have a precious mistress by name Syamavati who is the Visakha of today.

He too with 84,000 companions shall leave his home (praising) Maitreya. (Taisho Daizokyo, vol. 14, p. 424c.)</p><p>The scene itself is self-explanatory, with an attendant kneeling to receive the locks of the queen’s hair as her head is shaved. As a counter-balance to the horses on the right side, there is a hexagonal kiosk (apparently portable or actually being carried, judging from the way in which the base is draped, which is comparable to those seen in the procession of Zhang Yichao and his wife in Cave 156 [Dunhuang bihua, Pl. 189]). Its sides are decorated with square panels each containing a flower, alternately blue and orange, green and red, in the same fashion as is seen on the back of Stein painting 71 (Pl. 74-2). In front of this kiosk, a large rock is lying on the ground, not just a perfunctory attempt (as seen behind the horses on the right) at continuing the representation of the landscape setting of the whole painting, but a literal representation of the 金山(golden rock, for 金山, golden sand) referred to in the fifth cartouche, disregarded by the people and left lying about “like tiles, stones, grass or lumps of earth” (Taisho Daizokyo, vol. 14, p. 424b).</p><p>Terukazu Akiyama has noted how the Mile xiasheng jing was the third most popular subject, after the paradises of Amitabha and Bhaisajyaguru, with sixty-eight examples in the Dunhuang Institute list. With such a numerous filiation of illustrations to the sutra, the painter could easily resort to abbreviation, condensation, or conflation of the scenes without fear of being misunderstood. I believe that it is important to realize that the present painting on silk, like the sutra itself, is principally concerned with describing the joys of the time when Maitreya shall be born. Some of the scenes, particularly those of the wedding feast, and those of ploughing and reaping, were taken directly from pre-Buddhist Chinese depictions, keeping their original associations of peace and plenty: there is no need to interpret them as allusions to the Way of Hungry Ghosts or the Way of Animals, as some scholars have suggested, nor to see them as “some Maitreya legend not contained in the sutra”, as Waley wrote.</p><p>The date of the painting is not easy to fix exactly, but the examination of the individual scenes has already shown that it cannot be early in the sequence of Maitreya paradises at Dunhuang and Wanfoxia. The landscape setting does not differ greatly in technique from that of the early Northern Song in Cave 61 (Grottes, Pl. CCⅦ), but the greater compactness and coherence of the ordination scenes in the foreground, closer to a late ninth century model, suggest a date early in the tenth century.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代末期～五代初期,9世紀末～10世紀初</p><p>絹本設色</p><p>高138.7釐米 寬116.0釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫11.Ch.lviii.001</p><p>參照Figs.10-13</p><p>此圖是描繪壯麗的淨土，根据畫面上段和下段若干場景中插入的記錄《彌勒下生經》經文的長方形題箋判斷，這是《彌勒下生經變相圖》。同一主題的其他例子，有如秋山光和教授在《域文化研究 第6卷》的論文中所示。</p><p>有關構圖，正如松本榮一與秋山光和先生指出的，與同一主題的壁畫和紙繪等其他的例子比較，更爲稠密和複雜。中央一塊是佛和圍著他的一群侍者，間隙中精美的文樣被背光遮埋（參照圖12－2）。後方是手持一付帶有幡尾是黑白矢羽紋樣的三叉戟的毘沙門天、持劍的廣目天，全都有隨立的護法神。主要三尊像的下方左右兩側，除了有二脅侍菩薩外，背後還各有一身有菩薩跟隨的佛（參照圖12－3）。這些像在構圖上均斜置，然而在此處似乎畫家也試圖表現諸尊的正面，所以背光大都呈完整圓形，身體也基本向正前方，爲了表示相互間的關係，只有頭部被繪成側面的。這種描繪，與所見的《藥師淨土變相圖》或《觀經變相圖》（參照第1卷圖18、19）等，9世紀前半葉三尊像中洗煉的群像成爲對照。</p><p>此畫不局限於《彌勒下生經變相圖》的最大特色是，有描繪剃髮的場面。此畫的場景出現在畫面最下段的兩側（參照圖12－6）。中央部位兩個面對的高臺（參照Fig.13）上，擺放著卷狀物或是成捆的絹匹、高大的水瓶、銀質輪花器皿、盛滿菓子及穀物的六個竹籠等豐美的供物。表現剃發的場景，右側是國王，左側是王妃，被衆多隨從圍繞在中間接受剃發。右側圖中，有配鞍的三匹馬和手牽繮繩的馬夫一人，左側圖中有貼著各種顔色嵌板的六角形亭子，兩圖都賞心悅目。這兩組圖的中間，配置著帶傘蓋的台座，其周圍可見忙於幹活的數個人物（參照圖12－6）。</p><p>與畫面下端的這些情景相呼應的，是畫面上端展開的富有故事性的場景（參照圖12－5）。是繪在與主尊華蓋頂同一高度的山脈和尖樹梢上方，細細的帶狀部分裏。此種情景，在絹繪以外的白描畫稿（參照Fig.85）、敦煌以及萬佛峽壁畫等處的《彌勒下生經變相圖》中也能見到。其中被認作是9世紀的萬佛峽榆林窟第25窟西壁的《彌勒下生經變相圖》（參照Buddhist all-Paintings,圖版30）是非常美的作品，下面還會涉及到。</p><p>此絹繪《彌勒下生經變相圖》中，故事圖部分皆有長方形框，里面寫有關的經文。那裏所記述的，是取自《彌勒下生經》中轉輪聖王儴佉治理國家時，彌勒作爲翅頭末城婆羅門的兒子誕生的預言。場景的順序，是沿著長方形題箋中所記經文的顺序，进行必要的改變。所有經文都引自鳩摩羅什所譯的（參照《大正大藏經》第14卷No.454～455頁）《彌勒下生經》，但可見到寫經生的誤寫，爲了有助於理解經文，在這裏把誤寫部分做了改正的標識。</p><p>從右上端開始探討，最初的長方形題箋中，記述的是未來彌勒成佛時，將得到的安樂的狀態。</p><p>爾時人民命中自然行誦（詣）椓（塚）間如死時生安樂</p><p>無有怨賊劫竊之患城邑聚樂（落）無開（閉）門者時</p><p>（屆時，人人生命臨盡結束時自然向墳墓行進，在那裏死去。人人度過充滿和平幸福的生活，（那國度）勿用擔心盜賊小偷，城邑中無人關閉門戶。）</p><p>關於此題記的第一行內容，繪在此畫別的部分中，稍後加以贅述。右上角的畫面表現三個男人圍坐在一個長桌子周圍，在掛著窗簾的鋪地毯的房間。桌子上有杯盤，雖然只是勉強看得見，兩個侍從還在上菜。另外，一男一女在一個大鏡子前面站著，最後一個細節在榆林第25窟9世紀繪畫(Warner, 1938, Pl. XLI A; Lo Archive, no. 3020)中對這個場景的描述中沒有出現，鏡子的省略提示了聖像的其它一些成分也會因爲缺乏空間而被迫省略了。榆林第25窟的繪畫雖然沒有表現鏡子，但表現了掛著窗簾的屋子里一群婦女和一個俯臥的男子，與宴會的場面相對。秋山教授列舉出《彌勒下生經變》白描畫稿（參照Fig.85）中同樣的一群婦人攜帶供物的場景，並指出她們可能是讚頌彌勒的轉輪聖王儴佉的王女们。但是，有關這種宴會場景的人物，無論在畫稿還是壁畫中，都只附了簡單的說明文，無法瞭解確切的情況。在敦煌第12窟的壁畫（參照《敦煌壁畫》圖版178）中，可見到宴會的場面、衆多婦人、俯首的人物、鏡子、並排而立的男女等所有的東西，它們之間鋪著地毯的室內，描繪著箱裝的禮品。那宴會的場面中，有婦人們圍繞著新娘，顯然體現的是婚宴。《彌勒下生經》中有在彌勒淨土人人都能長壽這一節，可能描繪的是“女人年五百歲爾乃行嫁”的場景（參照《中國石窟 敦煌莫高窟》第3卷圖版142的解說）。無論哪一場景，畫家的意圖是盡可能描繪出安樂的情景，正如松本榮一博士曾推斷過的，不是體現餓鬼道的場景。</p><p>第二個長方形題箋所記錄的文字如下：</p><p>亦無衰惱水火刀兵及之居謹榮親爾時之天龍</p><p>神王不見其身如雨華香供養於佛三千大千世界時</p><p>（將無悲哀、憂傷、洪水、火災、戰爭、兵亂，也無饑餓、毒害等任何的損失。從而天人和聖衆，即使不露身影也降下花和香供養於佛前。三千大千世界……。）</p><p>畫面中描繪著桌子前面有三個男人，桌子上放著錢褡。背後有挂著長衣服的衣服架，桌子前方放著水瓶。榆林窟第25窟的壁畫中見不到此畫面。這個主題很明顯是繁榮場景中的一個，是第一場景的繼續。</p><p>第三景不僅在《彌勒下生經》中，在其他世俗畫中也常見到的非常熟悉的情景，是有名的描繪死者生前生活的，例如甘肅省嘉峪關魏晉墓的畫像磚（參照《漢唐壁畫》圖版49），和有貞觀四年（630年）題記的陝西省李壽墓的壁畫（參照同上，圖版59），可見到與此畫幾乎完全相同的場景。</p><p>該圖中所附的長方形題箋，如果没有經文的幫助則無法讀懂最初一行，但能明白它是緊接前一長方形題箋引用部分的後面。</p><p>爾時[皆大震動佛身出光照無量]</p><p>國應可度者皆得見佛時</p><p>（三千大世界）巨大震動，彌勒身體發出的光照亮無限的國土。那光經過的所有國土將見到佛。）</p><p>畫家在這一場景中，加入中國繪畫中非常熟悉的牛耕圖，有接續最初的情景，描繪農業生産繁榮景象的意思。在榆林窟第25窟以及其他《彌勒下生經變相圖》中的，除了用兩頭牛耕地的男人外，還绘有脫粒、过篩的作業，此絹畫由於沒有空間未能充分描繪出來。這種脫粒、过篩的圖，是在3世紀的嘉峪關畫像磚（參照《漢唐壁畫》圖版44）和四川省出土的漢代畫像石中也可見到的古老題材。在敦煌第61窟的與此相应場景的記述中，可知和經文有直接關連的一節（那一節“美味皆充足”，通过義淨譯的经文可以瞭解：參照《大正大藏經》第14卷No.455、426頁上段）。那是“當遇慈悲尊 美味皆充足 勤奮極勞力 耕種不以工”（參照《敦煌壁畫》圖版201），描述的是彌勒淨土中樂观的樣子，而在鳩摩羅什的譯本中有更爲樂观化的記述，即“一種七獲用功甚少所收甚多”（參照《大正大藏經》第14卷No.454、424頁）。</p><p>第四景的長方形題箋，接在中央部位有中庭的建築物右側，記述如下：</p><p>爾時人民各作是念壤佛千億</p><p>得免三惡世間無常命難救保時</p><p>（人們各自依次想到，即使免去一千億年的三惡道，這世間也不會永遠，命仍不會永續。）</p><p>畫面中，建築物中庭右角上畫有態度虔誠的四個男人，中庭對面只配置一群婦人。</p><p>第五長方形題箋連接在建築的左端：</p><p>爾時城邑舍宅及請利巷及至無有細微</p><p>純以金山（沙）霸地處皆有金銀之樶供養時</p><p>（（彌勒誕生的翅頭末城下）看不到城下所有的家（庭院）、以至所有的道路（通常是地面），地面上到處覆蓋著金沙，金銀成山。）</p><p>看繪畫，有可能是沒有空間，完全沒有描繪昂貴的金品。而畫面左下角的六角形亭子前畫的山岩，可能是畫家爲解釋經文語句中的“金山”畫出來的，旁邊可見指向那裏的男人身形。此人物在榆林窟第25窟的《彌勒淨土變相圖》中，是在這場景的正下方，起著從放在地上寶物旁通過的人物相同的作用。場景結構與榆林窟壁畫的基本相同，但描寫還是壁畫方面美的多，很出色。即本圖絹繪中，蜂巢形的小屋前坐著老夫婦，其前面的人物只是立著的男女各一人，而在榆林窟的壁畫中，小屋裏有一位拄著彎曲木杖，莊嚴的白髯老人，背對畫有山水的三折屏風而坐，向悲傷的妻子和家族揮手道別，他的身姿可明顯看出安祥和喜悅的表情。</p><p>關於這情景有若干個解釋，首先第一想到的，是最初長方形的第一行中所記錄的事情，即對 “人人生命臨盡結束時自願向墳墓行進，將在那裏死去。”這一部分的解釋。但是，據小屋的形狀和經文其他部分的記述，又有另一種解釋。即小屋的形狀很像在敦煌描繪非常盛行的圓錐形庵（參照第1卷圖19－3），表現的是經典的“到了彌勒時代，人人將把時間花費在信仰生活和坐禪上”這部分的觀點。第三種解釋是把老夫婦當作彌勒的父母,不過這種說法無法解釋圓錐形小屋以及榆林窟壁畫中所見(的周圍人物)悲傷表情。</p><p>畫面上部最後的長方形題箋接左端的镶边，記錄如下：</p><p>□□既轉法輪度天巳將諸弟子入城</p><p>□□□衆供敬從佛入翅頭末城當入</p><p>□□□無量變現釋提恒國（因）供養時</p><p>（（彌勒）轉法輪，救度完聖衆和人們雙方時，將和諸弟子一同入城。無數聖衆尊重佛，後來入翅頭末城，當他們入城後，見到種種神力、奇象。）</p><p>伴隨它的畫面，由於空間不夠，描繪得極其緊縮。榆林窟第25窟中，與絹繪相反面的右上角上，有包括翅頭末城、從跪著的貴人手中接受布施的佛陀和侍者們、打掃城牆外側的鬼神、空中的龍等在内的大規模的雄偉畫面，Langdon Warner教授將所有畫面與經典各節進行了比較。</p><p>畫面最下段的各場景，使人馬上聯想到與長方形題箋中的記述和《彌勒下生經》的關係，它們不同於上端的擴大的幸福和繁榮概念的場景，都是具體的事件，所以比較容易描繪，而且採取的是中國畫家在淨土圖中特別重視的左右相稱的構圖形式。</p><p>有關下段的各場景，從右開始看，最初的長方形題箋出現在國王剃髮場面的右側，記錄如下：</p><p>爾時儴佉王亦供八萬四千大乘供遶□出</p><p>家學道亦復有八萬四千至婆羅門供養時</p><p>（那時，儴佉王也和敬繞他的八萬四千大臣一同出家學道。還有八萬四千婆羅門也……。）</p><p>有關這場面，榆林窟第25窟的壁畫下部中央描繪的，遠不如此絹画的圖出色。右端有馬這一點也非常有意義。角落里出现的马，他们对国王的侍从的重要性起到了相当的强调作用，但在壁畫中卻沒有這種描繪。实际上，在壁畫中，緊靠這一群人旁也有一匹馬，而那只是作爲轉輪聖王的七寶（參照第1卷圖40的解說）之一。該繪畫的作者，可能不是從宗教上的意義出發，而僅是爲了加大剃髮儀式的群體，多加了三匹馬，這卻取得很大成功。</p><p>下一長方形題簽是綠色的，在擺著供物、水瓶的右側供物台和中央部位有華蓋的台座之間，記錄如下：</p><p>爾時婆羅門聚明大知於佛法</p><p>中亦共出家造塔供養時</p><p>（那時，聰明大智，修學佛法的婆羅門，一同出家，造塔供養。）</p><p>“造塔”這一記述不見於經典中，如威力所指出的，場景本身也不是建造佛塔，而是爲贈送彌勒，而拆開嵌寶石的玉座的場面。此經典的和闐語譯，“婆羅門”不是對“佛法”，而是對婆羅門經典比較熟悉的人。在榆林窟第25窟的壁畫中，兩層樓閣的屋顶完全被拆下，可清楚地看出是解體工作。</p><p>在此場景的前景中，又插入一条記文如下的長方形題箋，但未繪有關的畫。</p><p>爾時族婆羅門子名須摩提利</p><p>根智惠金鬱名羅是與六萬人時</p><p>（那時，彌勒一親族的婆羅門之子，慧眼智惠的須摩提，即現在的鬱多羅，與六萬人一同……。）</p><p>再次，没有空间用来作为特殊说明了。此題箋的上方是第四個長方形題箋，未繪有關的畫。其記錄如下：</p><p>爾時□□法出家如是等 無量千億衆見世苦</p><p>惱皆於彌勒佉（佛）法中出家□□供養時</p><p>（那時，行這些佛法名義的出家，見世間苦惱的幾千幾億人民皆將出家於彌勒佛法中。）</p><p>最後的長方形題箋，配在王妃剃發場景的右側，記錄如下：</p><p>爾時儴佉王寶女名舍彌婆帝金之毗舍供佉是亦與</p><p>八萬四千綵女俱供出家儴佉王太子名曰天色今</p><p>提婆郍（那？）是亦與八萬四千人俱供出家彌勒佛謁時</p><p>（儴佉王的王妃一人舍彌婆帝，是現在的毘舍佉，她與八萬四千個綵女一同出家。儴佉王的太子一人天色，是今天的提婆沙那，他也和八萬四千個侍從一同出家。）</p><p>圖是一眼便知的描繪王妃剃發的場景，還可見跪著接王妃剃落頭髮的侍女的身姿。爲了對應國王剃髮圖中的馬，在這裏添加了六角亭子。此亭子明顯是可以搬動的，從底部挂布的垂落狀態看，確實是正在被搬運的樣子。在敦煌第156窟的《張議潮夫婦出行圖》（參照《敦煌壁畫》圖版第189）中，也可見到搬運同樣形狀的轎子。亭子外側飾有圓形花紋的方形圖板，是青色和橙、綠、紅色交錯組合配飾的，與圖74的絹繪裏層（參照圖74－2）裝飾很相似。亭前的地面上橫著巨大的岩石，這有異於畫面空白處敷衍的描繪（例如馬背後所見的岩石）。是在上段第五條長方形題箋中所述，接受了經典的字句“金山”而表現的場景。那“金沙”是“棄之於地猶如瓦石草木土塊”，被人們忽視，被廢棄的。</p><p>據秋山教授講，除《阿彌陀淨土圖》、《藥師淨土圖》之外, 《彌勒下生經變相圖》是第三種最常见的作品，敦煌文物研究所的目錄一覽表中有68件。産生出如此多的《彌勒下生經變相圖》，是因有不少的素材，對畫家來說，省略多少或壓縮、合成等都不必擔心會誤解，是最大的原因。我想，理解描繪此畫的情景，與經典自身一樣，應把表現彌勒誕生時的喜悅當作第一要素。因此，把佛教傳入之前，中國原本流行的描繪結婚的喜宴、耕作、收穫的喜悅等若干場景，採納進來，營造出了祥和、富庶的氛圍。正如一部分研究者指出的，沒必要特意考慮那些與餓鬼道和畜生道是否有聯繫，同時像Waley所講的，也沒必要考慮“經典中沒有的彌勒故事”。</p><p>此畫的年代難以判斷，把迄今觀察到的各種場面，與敦煌石窟和榆林窟的《彌勒下生經變相圖》做比較，則沒有證據說明比那些繪畫早一點。技術上，山水描繪與北宋初期的敦煌第61窟（參照《石窟圖錄》圖版207）無多大差別。而剃髮場景中所見到的被概括濃縮的描繪，説明其時代近於9世紀末、10世紀初的時候。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 13"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.33</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="san-Latn">Samantabhadra</title><title lang="chi-Hant">普賢菩薩圖</title><note lang="eng"><p>Late Tang or early Five Dynasties, late 9th –early 10th century A.

Ch. xxxvii. 005</p><p>The paintings shown in Pls. 13 and 14 form a matching pair, unique among the silk paintings of the stein collection, but clearly intended to serve the same purpose as similar wall paintings showing the two Bodhisattvas, one on either side of a central niche with Sakyamuni, or on either side of the doorway on the entrance wall, in several of the caves at Dunhuang. One feature that remains unexplained, however, is the curved upper border of the two paintings (Pls. 13-2, 14-1). It suggests that they were hung in a cave-temple with barrel-vaulted roof, but no such cave exists at dunhuang itself. Such semi-circular vaults are of course seen in shrines at other central Asian sites such as Bezeklik and Kucha. Nevertheless, in style and composition the two Bodhisattva paintings are readily comparable with wall paintings at Dunhuang, for example, Cave 36 (Dunhuang bihua, Pl. 160), and especially at Yulin, Cave 16 (Lo Archive, no. 2966).</p><p>Both Bodhisattvas are shown riding their respective vehicles, the white elephant and the lion, each with a black keeper who occupies a prominent foreground position. In fact the elephant and the lion themselves are somewhat difficult to make out, lost among the wealth of decorative detail so that only their heads and a part of their hind flanks emerge. This is in sharp contrast with the paintings dated A. D. 836 and A.D. 864 (Vol. 1, Pls. 16, 23), where the two animals are depicted standing almost free.</p><p>The retinues of the two Bodhisattvas are very similar. The heads of a number of attendant Bodhisattvas emerge beyond the borders of the aureoles, together with three red-faced Dharmapalas in each painting. In the foreground corners, on the left and right respectively, are two standing Bodhisattvas, each holding a fan and with their voluminous sleeves supported by smaller attendants, very much in the fashion of Chinese and other rulers in the audiences of the famous debate between Manjusri and Vimalskirti (Vol. 1, Pl. 20). In front and leading the procession are musicians ,better preserved on Samantabhadra’s side, where they play a bili 篳篥 (double-reed flute) and a sheng 笙 (mouth organ )(Pl. 13-3). The whole of each assembly is seen advancing towards the centre, as evidenced by the swaying of the canopies above the main figures. Samantabhadra’s appearance corresponds with the chapter on Samantabhadra in the Lotus Sutra (Taisho Daizokyo, vol. 9, no. 262, p. 61a), where he is described as coming from the east accompanied by many Bodhisattvas, musicians, and other beings in order to hear Sakyamuni preach at the Vulture Peak.</p><p>Turning to the style and execution of the two paintings, we may first of all see that much of the surface pigment has been lost, so that the colours are less intense than originally painted and the ink lines of the preparatory drawing are revealed, Especially in details such as the faces, there are quite substantial changes between the original outlines and the final colouring and finishing touches. Prominent features of both paintings are the decorative patterns formed by the aureoles, and the slightly aloof stance of many of the figures, stiffly leaning backwards. Close parallels can be seen in Cave 16 at Yulin (Lo Archive, no 2966) and Cave 36 at Dunhuang (Dunhuang bihua, Pl. 160). The latter is said to date from the middle Tang, that is, the period of Tibetan control (A.D. 781-847), but a slightly later date seems possible in view of this stiffness, and facial details such as the eyelids, drawn with an almost straight line, and the mouth, small with a dividing line ending in downturned hooks.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代末期～五代初期，9世紀末～10世紀初</p><p>絹本設色</p><p>高218.7釐米 寬114.8釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫34.Ch.xxxvii.005</p><p>圖13和14中所介紹的一對圖，在斯坦因收集的絹繪中，是無其他例子的特殊作品，而在敦煌石窟中，在深牆中央的佛龕左右或入口處左右兩邊都可見幾例描繪與此畫相似的二菩薩圖，顯然其製作與壁畫有著相同的目的。不過沒有任何說明文，是因這兩個圖上部的鑲邊是彎曲所致这一点（參照圖13－2，14－1），說明這兩個圖可能是懸在拱形藻井上的，但敦煌并沒有這樣藻井的石窟，藻井只見于伯孜克里克和庫車等中亞其他窟寺遺迹中。然而，在風格和構圖上，這些圖卻顯然與敦煌第36窟的壁畫（參照《敦煌壁畫》圖版160），特別是榆林窟第16圖的壁畫（參照羅寄梅No.2966）等很相似。</p><p>兩菩薩各自乘坐白象和獅子，禦手黑人少年在前面被畫得很大。象和獅子在各式各樣的裝飾中，只露出頭和側腹的一部分，很難辨別。有吐蕃佔領時期的丙辰年（836年）和咸通五年（864年）紀年的作品（參照第1卷圖16、23）中能見到大象和獅子的全身，與此形成鮮明的對比。</p><p>兩圖侍從的描繪非常相似。隨行菩薩的頭部大多從頭光的內區越到外區，兩圖中同樣的描繪還可見有三身的紅色臉龐的天王像。前景的左右角各站一身手持團扇的菩薩，矮小的侍者托著他肥大的衣袖。這在集聚在中國聽文殊和維摩的著名辯论的其他國家的統治者的隊伍（參照第1卷圖20）中也有相似的情景。在隊伍前面，兩圖均繪有樂人（參照圖13－3），普賢菩薩圖的保存較好，他們彈奏著篳篥和笙。從中尊上方隨風起伏的華蓋看，像是每個群體都向中央行進。普賢菩薩的出現是《法華經·普賢勸發品》（參照《大正大藏經》第9卷No.262，61頁上段）中說的，那裏說普賢菩薩是帶領菩薩和樂人等衆多隨從，從東方前來靈鷲山聽釋迦說法的。</p><p>再看風格和繪法，首先是顔料的脫落嚴重，失去了當時華麗色彩的同時，浮現出了底稿的墨線。特別是臉部等的細部描繪，可發現底稿線和完成時的勾勒線完全不一致。其它可舉出的兩圖共通的顯著表現，还有各種文樣的背光在兩圖中分佈在大致對應的位置，諸尊間均留有小間隔，回頭向後的身體姿勢僵硬。榆林窟第16窟（參照羅寄梅No.2966）和敦煌第36窟（參照《敦煌壁畫》圖版160）中也有與此相似的描繪。據說敦煌第36窟是中唐吐蕃佔領時期（781～847年）的洞窟，與其相比，此畫表現有些僵硬的感覺。如從臉部的細部表現看，眼瞼部所有的線幾乎都是直的，口極小，唇線兩端勾狀線向下彎曲等，可能時代略晚些。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription>-<msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 15">-<msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.26</idno></msIdentifier>-<msContents>-<msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Vaisravana riding across the waters</title><title lang="chi-Hant">行道天王圖</title>-<note lang="eng"><p>Five Dynasties, mid-10th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on silk</p><p>Painted area: H. 61.8 cm, W. 57.4 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting26. Ch. xxxvii. 002</p><p>See also Figs. 14, 15</p><p>As already demonstrated by Eiichi Matsumoto, this painting of Vaisravana is related to others found by Le Coq and Grunwedel in the shrines at Bezeklik, where the guardian king is shown riding on a horse. In other respects, the painting is similar to that shown in the following plate (Pl. 16), as the entire party is seen advancing to the right across the sea, in a landscape bordered by mountains on the horizon. The setting must represent Vaisravana’s domain to the north of Mt. Sumeru, which is said to have had three cities, a park and a lake. One of the cities may be represented by the building seen in the upper left(Fig. 15); the lake is perhaps referred to in the votive inscription opposite, which reads:</p><p>The devaraja on his way across the waters, preaching, offered with whole heart by the chief donor Xu Hanrong.</p><p>This identification, as Matsumoto has pointed out, is a useful clue to the probable appearance of a number of paintings with similar titles, ascribed to famous painters and listed in records such as the catalogue of Emperor Huizong’s collection in the Xuanhe huapu 宣和畫譜 (A.D. 1120). Possibly, as suggested by Waley according to a story in the Bishamen yigui 昆沙門儀軌, Vaisravana is in fact shown on his way to relieve the siege of Anxi 安西 in A.D. 742. Alternatively, Vaisravana is probably shown patrolling his domain, in his function as chief protector of the Buddhist Law.</p><p>The main figures are all supported on clouds. Vaisravana, in golden armour on a white horse, is surrounded by a retinue consisting of his five sons (in armour similar to that of Vaisravana himself ) and a number of yaksas. The sons carry banners, Vaisravana’s stupa and his bow. The yaksas have demonic faces and those in the foreground are seen rushing to pick up precious objects: coral, golden cash, a golden flask, a gourd-shaped bottle, flaming pearls, and so on (Fig. 14). In addition, a high official, holding a tablet, and his wife, with elaborate headdress in early tenth century style, stand behind Vaisravana’s horse. They very much have the appearance of donor figures, rather than of forming part of Vaisravana’s retinue of yaksas and warriors. Perhaps in fact the official is the principal donor mentioned in the inscription. The painting exhibits a very limited range of colours, with an orange-red dominant throughout, being used both for the bodies of the yaksa figures and as edging to the armour and to the clouds. Many of the clouds were originally blue, but this colour has not survived well.</p><p>The lower part of the painting shows three infant souls struggling to swim in the water, with a pair of ducks and lotus flowers. On the right, a sea-monster appears with gaping jaws, and a small figure of a woman who, like the swimming infants, gazes upwards at Vaisravana. As pointed out by Waley, she must be Vaisravana’s sister, Sri Devi (Pl. 15-3). On the left, the zig-zag bank of the pool contains a tiny landscape of low hills and sharp-pointed peaks, with a white-spotted brown deer in the foreground (Pl. 15-4). The deer is related in scale to the main picture, but the landscape itself is reminiscent of that in Vol. 1, Pl. 21.At the top of the painting is a narrow range of triangular peaks, set along the horizon, with red clouds above.</p><p>A mid-tenth century date seems virtually certain, in view of the elaborate tenth century headdress of the high-born lady behind Vaisravana, the limited range of colours, the symmetrically disposed flowers, and the facial details, both of Vaisravana himself and of his attendant warriors. The square format using a single width of silk is comparable to that of other votive paintings of the same date.</p></note>-<note lang="chi-Hant"><p>五代時期,10世紀中葉</p><p>絹本設色</p><p>高61.8釐米 寬57.4釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫26.Ch.xxxvii.002</p><p>參照Figs.14、15</p><p>正如松本榮一博士曾經指出的，此畫在毘沙門天騎馬的這一點上，與勒柯克和格倫韋德爾在高昌、伯孜克里克發現的騎馬姿勢的行道天王圖有關連。其他方面，圖的形式大致與刊載的下一圖（參照圖16）相同，渡海的隊伍向右方行進，水平線上有山相連。畫面上顯示的可能是毘沙門天守護的須彌山之北方。那裏有“三大城郭”、“苑”和“池”，畫面左上方的建築物可能是那城郭之一（參照Fig.15）。右上方的功德銘中記有“水路天王行道時 施主徐漢榮一心供養”。</p><p>如松本博士指出的，可以判定此畫是《行道天王圖》，徽宗皇帝的收藏品目錄《宣和畫譜》（1120年）中，也以同樣畫題記錄了出自著名畫家之手的多件作品，爲想象此畫面的樣子提供了有效的線索。Waley介紹此是根據《毘沙門儀軌》的故事，針對天寶元年（742年）的安西的救濟而表現的毘沙門天的說法難以信服。因爲同樣的描繪，在高昌和伯孜克里克等處更早些年代製造的壁畫中也可見到。結論是，作爲佛法守護者的毘沙門天，可能是在自己的守護區內進行巡查。</p><p>主要的像都表現在雲上。毘沙門天身著金鎧甲乘白馬，由五個兒子（身著和毘沙門天一樣的鎧甲）和衆多夜叉圍繞。兒子們各持象徵毘沙門天的塔、幡、弓等。夜叉有魔鬼般的臉，他們被描繪成在前景中熱衷於採集珊瑚、金幣、金瓶、瓢簞形瓶、火焰寶珠等貴重物品的姿勢（參照Fig.14）。毘沙門天的馬後方，跟隨著持笏的高官和他的著10世紀早期華麗髮飾的夫人。他們更像供養人，而不是夜叉或武者形象的毘沙門天侍从的一部分，或許是題記中所提到的施主徐漢榮本人吧。使用的顔色非常有限，相同的橙紅色使用在夜叉身體、鎧甲以及雲的邊緣等很多地方，成爲貫通整體的主調。雲彩的多處本來塗了青色，但現在殘留的很少。</p><p>畫面下方有水中遊戲的三個兒童和兩隻鴨子、蓮花等。其右方有張開大嘴的海妖和小的婦人像，那婦人和戲水的兒童們一樣，仰望著毘沙門天（參照圖15－3）。如Waley所指，她無疑是毘沙門天的妹妹功德天。左下角從鋸齒狀岸邊一直擴展的平地，繪著尖的山峰和山丘，其前面露出带白色斑點的茶色鹿的上半身（圖15－4）。此鹿與畫面中央的各像相比，有些縮小。而鋸齒狀的岸邊，使人想起《勞度叉鬥聖變》（參照第1卷圖21）中的描繪。畫面上端與地平線間狹小的空間裏，排列著三角形山脈，其上漂浮著紅色的雲彩。</p><p>跟隨毘沙門天後方的貴婦人首飾，顯示了10世紀的精巧式樣，限定的色彩的色數，長方形題簽框旁邊配的左右相稱的花朵。再有，毘沙門天和簇擁他的眷屬的臉部描繪，等等表現來看，考慮此畫的製作年代在10世紀中葉較爲妥當。也可與同時代的其他用一幅絹，幾乎是正方形的畫面的功德畫做比較。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 16"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.45</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Vaisravana on his way across the waters</title><title lang="chi-Hant">行道天王圖</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 9th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on silk</p><p>H. 37.6cm, W. 26.6cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting45. Ch. 0018</p><p>This painting, on a small scale, is one of the most highly finished among all the paintings from Dunhuang and has been preserved together with a substantial part of its original mount of yellow and purple silk, extending for 8.5 cm above the painting and for 11.5 cm below. With Pl. 15 and another painting in the Musée Guimet, it represents a type otherwise only known through titles such as “The Heavenly King on the March” in records such as the catalogue of Emperor Huizong’s collection, Xuanhe huapu (A.D. 1120). Essentially the composition is intended to show Vaisravana patrolling his domain with heavenly troops; unlike the preceding plate, there is no building to represent a city, but otherwise the setting is similar.</p><p>Vaisravana and his retinue are seen supported on a purple cloud, advancing across a sea of waves, bordered in the far distance by a range of mountains (Pl. 16-5). In this procession Vaisravana himself is the dominant figure, almost twice the size of his attendants. In his right hand he carries a golden halberd, in his left a purple cloud supporting a stupa, inside which there appears to be a seated Buddha. These attributes are immediately suggestive of his role as chief of the protectors of the Buddhist Law. Vivid plumes of flame, blown by the wind, issue from his shoulders. These, attested in the texts, correspond to the stiff crescents of flame seen in single standing figures of Vaisravana, as in Vol. 1, Fig. 109 (see the extensive discussion by Eiichi Matsumoto in Tonkoga no kenkyu, part 3, chapter 9). White ribbons flutter upwards on either side of the richly decorated crown (Pl. 16-2).</p><p>In front of Vaisravana, also moving forwards but turning towards him, in graceful contrapposto, is Sri Devi, his sister, holding a shallow golden dish of flowers (Pl. 16-3). On the other side he is accompanied by the rishi Vasu, delicately portrayed as a white-haired old man in sandals, wearing a white cloth about his loins and holding a golden chalice (Pl. 16-4). Behind him is a stout figure in a green robe holding a flaming pearl. Matsumoto has identified him as one of the five sons of Vaisravana. Another figure, wearing a four-pronged crown stands on the left, with hands in anjali-mudra. As he is unarmed and without other attributes, he is very similar to the figure, apparently a donor, who appears in Pl. 15 holding a tablet and accompanied by his wife. Nevertheless, as he seems to be more closely integrated with the whole group, Matsumoto’s identification of him as another son of Vaisravana seems a better suggestion. Immediately behind him is a magnificent bearded figure in a splendid hat, fitting an arrow to his bow and preparing to shoot down the garuda figure who scuttles away in flight at the top right of the picture. Matsumoto has noted examples of similar garuda figures in wall paintings of Vaisravana in the Turfan area. They represent the forces of evil against which Vaisravana offered protection. The remaining figures in the painting are some of the five yaksa warriors who accompany the guardian king as described in several texts. The setting represents the park and stretch of water that are features of Vaisravana’s abode, to the north of Mt. Sumeru.</p><p>Of great interest in connection with this small painting is the drawing P.5018 (1) in the Bibliotheque Nationale (Jao Tsong-yi, 1978, Pl.Ⅳ). Part of this appears to be a full-scale drawing of the silk painting. Although Jao Tsong-yi assumed that the right half of the drawing was missing, comparison with the Stein painting shows that in fact only the figure of Sri Devi has been lost. In all its detail, from the great figure of Vaisravana holding a stupa and a lance to the individual expressions of all those about him, this drawing corresponds exactly to the painting. For example, the garuda mask at his waist is identical, and the two bosses on his chest are even clearer as small faces. Practically the only differences in the drawing are the omission of the supporting cloud, of the water and distant landscape, and of the fleeing garuda. As in the silk painting, one member of Vaisravana’s retinue, wearing a faceted hat, scowls upwards, no doubt taking aim, though the bow is missing. The absence of the garuda, together with this implication of his presence, strongly suggests that the drawing is more in the nature of a sketch copy of the painting than a preparatory cartoon for it. This impression is confirmed when we look at a second composition placed adjacent to the first on the same sheet, and at right angles to it: this shows Vaisravana kneeling and offering a stupa, and must have been copied from another painting.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代,9世紀</p><p>絹本設色</p><p>高37.6釐米 寬26.6釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫45.Ch.0018</p><p>此作品規模雖小，但在敦煌出土的繪畫類中是最精細的作品之一，包括繪畫上下方各留8.0釐米、11.5釐米寬的黃色和紫色裝裱部分，整個作品保存狀態良好。和上一圖（圖15）以及集美美術館收藏的《行道天王圖》，都可作爲一種資料，由此想象出徽宗皇帝收藏品目錄《宣和畫譜》（1120年）等中，只有題名的這一類繪畫的圖樣。圖樣表現的是毘沙門天在天界軍隊的陪同下，巡查自己守護的領地。與上一圖不同的是，這裏沒有代表城郭的建築物，其餘場面設計基本相同。</p><p>毘沙門天和侍從乘赤紫色雲，橫渡波浪起伏的海面，水平線的另一岸有連綿的山脈（參照圖16－5）。高大的毘沙門天像有侍從们的兩倍，右手持鉾槍，從左手騰起的赤紫色雲上載著寶塔，寶塔中有坐佛。這些所持物品暗示著佛法守護神毘沙門天的作用。由兩肩升起的鮮豔火焰，被風吹的向後飄伏。這與第1卷Fig.109的《兜跋毘沙門天像》中出現的僵直的三日月形火焰相同，是根據經典裏描繪的（詳情參照松本榮一『敦煌畫の研究』第3章第9節）。配有華麗裝飾的冠的兩側，有白色的緞帶隨風飄動（參照圖16－2）。</p><p>毘沙門天的前面，有舉止優雅，向同一方行進卻回頭看他的妹妹功德天，手捧盛滿花的金色盤。其對面的婆藪仙，以手持金杯，纏白腰布，腳穿靴的白髮老人的形象出現（參照圖16－4）。其後有身著綠衣，手持火焰寶珠的健壯的像。松本榮一博士認爲該像是毘沙門天五個兒子之一。左方也有一身合掌的像，頭戴頂部分成四塊的冠。他沒有武裝，也沒有攜帶物品，認爲與上一圖的手持笏陪同夫人的供養人像相同。但在本圖中，其像與整體非常協調，正如松本博士所提議的，看作是毘沙門天的一個兒子更爲貼切。離他很近的後方，有一長著美麗的鬍鬚，頭戴奇特帽子的像，拉開弓箭的架式，像是要射向畫面右上角慌忙飛過的迦樓羅。松本博士指出，繪有毘沙門天的吐魯番地區的壁畫中，有几處相同的迦樓羅的影子，它象徵用毘沙門天的力量可趕走的惡勢力。此畫的其他諸像，正如松本博士所述，著於若干經典中，是天王侍從五夜叉中的四像。場面設置是毘沙門天所守護的須彌山北方。</p><p>與這小作品有關連的非常有趣味的作品中，還有巴黎國立圖書館藏白描畫（參照P.5018（1）：饒宗頤《敦煌白畫》圖版4）。那畫的一半，看似此圖的草稿，饒教授認爲其右半部分已缺失，但與斯坦因收集的此作品做比較則發現，其實只缺少功德天像。那白描畫和本圖的絹繪，從手持寶塔和槍的毘沙門天到簇擁他的眷屬，都可以一一對照。但細部的表現也略見不同，如腹部的獅頭大致相同，但胸部隆起的小型人面在白描畫中更爲明顯。兩者間大的差別，在於白描畫中省略了乘雲、水波、遠方的山水、飛的迦樓羅等。而毘沙門天的侍從中，頭戴多面體帽子的男性，缺弓的部分，但臉部的描繪卻與此絹繪仰頭瞄準上方的姿態相同。這裏雖然沒有描繪迦樓羅，但其表現反映了它的存在。所以，比起將此白描畫作爲草圖重新描繪的說法來，根據其他繪畫模寫的感覺則更強烈。如果再看一件接近的同樣紙描繪的圖案，則更能確定這種印象。毘沙門天跪著捧塔的形象，無疑是模寫其他作品。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 17"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.41</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Maitreya with Manjusri and Smantabhadra</title><title lang="chi-Hant">彌勒佛·文殊普賢菩薩圖</title><note lang="eng"><p>Five Dynasties, dated 4th year of Tianfu 天福 (A.D.939)</p><p>Ink and colours on silk</p><p>H.74.0 cm, W. 61.0cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting 41.

The exposed part of the chest appears almost as a rectangle (Pl. 17-2). The same stiffness is observable in Manjusri on the right, whose body is extremely long in proportion to the space left for the legs. This occurs since the three canopies and heads of the main figures are all on one level, while the lotus pedestals of the two Bodhisattvas are necessarily at a lower level than that of the central Buddha. Samantabhadra’s face if very clearly preserved (Pl. 17-3), as it was apparently never coloured and so still displays only the original ink drawing, without any lines subsequently added to accentuate the forms. Particularly noticeable are the straight line drawn to divide the lips, extending far to either side and angled downwards, and the manner in which the eye projects well beyond the contour of the face.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>五代時期，題記天福四年（939年）</p><p>絹本設色</p><p>高74.0釐米 寬61.0釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫41.Ch.00224</p><p>參照Fig.16</p><p>此畫雖傷殘嚴重，卻具有紀年的題記（參照Fig.16），是考證10世紀時繪畫發展的珍貴的樣例。描繪在寬61釐米的一幅絹子上的較小型作品，其整體結構與Fig.18非常相似。本圖中尊淡茶色的長方形題箋中記有彌勒佛的名字，推斷Fig.18的中尊也是彌勒佛。本圖彌勒佛隨帶著二尊，左邊記有聞隨補賢菩薩（普賢菩薩），右邊記有聞隨師離菩薩（文殊菩薩）。</p><p>彌勒佛的身體上是深橙色，略加了圖式化的暈染（參照圖17－2）。上衣間露出的胸口部分呈長方形，同樣僵硬感覺的表現也見于右側文殊菩薩的身上。文殊菩薩的上半身顯得異常長，那可能是因爲，儘管按需要把兩脅侍菩薩台座描繪得比中尊的台座低，但最初已將三尊的頭部和華蓋都描繪到平行的高度所導致的。文殊菩薩（參照圖17－3）的臉部保存完好，但見不到塗彩的痕迹。因此，其線描都是底稿的墨線，一点沒有加入完成時的勾勒線。特別值得注意的，是唇線拉出的直線，從嘴唇兩端向臉頰伸長，其兩端向下呈彎曲的鈎形，右眼越出臉部輪廓線外。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 18"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.2</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Avalokitesvara as Saviour from Perils</title><title lang="chi-Hant">法華經普門品變相圖</title><note lang="eng"><p>Five Dynasties or Northern Song, mid-to late 10th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on silk</p><p>H. 84.4cm, W. 61.7cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting2.

A dark green sash winds about them all.

Such representations are found not only in paintings on silk (see also Pls.21, 25) but in small votive booklets dedicated to Guanyin, such as that in the British Library (see Pl. 65, Figs. 92-95) where the representation, for instance, of peril by fire is almost identical to that shown here.</p><p>The painting has a patterned appearance due to the use of very few colours apart from black ink, which is used to good effect. The dark green already mentioned serves for grassy slopes, leaves and stems, as well as the scarves; orange-red serves for flames, robes, accessories like the fetters and cangue of the prisoner, flowers and cartouches; a light purple wash is used for schematic shading of the face and torso of the Bodhisattva, and for flowers and for the petals of his throne. Bright yellow represents golden ornaments, cartouches and the lining of one of the donor’s robes.

There, however, the figure is simply set against a rising full moon, while in this picture the aureole is banded, and there is in addition a nimbus behind the head. Stein painting 15 (Pl. 52), on paper, is closer to the formula of the Pelliot painting. In all three representations, Avalokitesvara holds the willow branch in one hand and a small vase in the other, and is flanked by bamboos.</p><p>As in the following plate, the costumes of the donors suggest a date no earlier than the middle of the tenth century. There are other resemblances as well, such as the way in which the narrow cartouches intended for the names of the donors are placed right alongside that for the principal inscription. The same lack of sophistication is visible in the execution of the setting for Avalokitesvara. The Bodhisattva is seated with one leg pendent, on a rocky pedestal which emerges from a lotus pool. The pool has the familiar zig-zag banks with modeling strokes in ink, but, unable to cope with the problems of delimiting the grassy top from the white edges, the painter has simply reversed the latter, so that the water, if strictly interpreted, would appear to be higher than the banks which contain it. The problem is solved correctly in the Pelliot painting earlier referred to.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>五代或北宋時期,10世紀中葉～末期</p><p>絹本設色</p><p>高70.5釐米 寬55.0釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫29.Ch.lvi.0015</p><p>參照Fig.17。</p><p>關於“水月觀音”這一主題，在伯希和收藏品的有天福八年（943年）紀年的華麗的《千手千眼觀音圖》（參照伯希和圖錄《敦煌的幡和繪畫》篇圖版101）的下欄左側的長方形題箋中有明確記錄。但與那背後只繪一輪滿月的像相比，本圖的像卻加了同心圓的條狀頭光和背光。這一點，在後面介紹的紙繪《水月觀音圖》（參照圖52）與伯希和收集品的繪畫更接近。三件中，觀音都是一手執小柳枝，一手持淨瓶，周圍環繞著竹子。</p><p>與下圖（圖20）相同，供養人的服飾表明這些畫不會早於10世紀中葉。與下圖還有其它相似點，比如記錄供養人名題記的細長方形題箋連接著中央的題記欄等，另外，對觀音的描繪同樣缺乏成熟的技法。此菩薩半跏趺姿勢，坐在漂浮于蓮池中的岩座上。蓮池有通常的鋸齒狀的岸邊，但若仔細觀察，水面和草叢的關係卻錯了位。那是因爲，從白色立起的岸邊到生長草叢的陸地部分沒有處理好，簡單地顛倒了峭立的斷面的緣故。上面所述對這部分的描繪，在伯希和收集品的《水月觀音圖》中是正確的。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 20"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.30</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Buddha</title><title lang="chi-Hant">佛倚像</title><note lang="eng"><p>Five Dynasties or Northern Song, mid-to late 10th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on silk</p><p>Painted area: H. 64.6 cm, W. 39.4cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting30.

This setting and the proportions of the composition, as well as the flowers in the upper corners, link it with the painting of Ksitigarbha (Pl. 8); the execution is however much coarser, and both the style of the figure and the costumes of the donors, with exaggeratedly stiff and long cap ribbons, suggest a somewhat later date, no earlier than the middle of the tenth century.</p><p>The painting is surrounded by its original broad border of red cotton in a 2:1 twill. As in the preceding plate, the spaces for the inscription and for the name of the Buddha are left blank, suggesting that this was a painting executed in anticipation, but never actually bought or brought into devotional use.

Ch.lvii.001</p><p>See Plate 14</p><p>With its background silk of an overall greenish line and the symmetrically disposed multi-coloured cartouches, this painting presents an attractive appearance and must originally have been even brighter. Avalokitesvara, in the centre on a lotus throne with hexagonal paneled base, is four-armed, holding aloft the sun and moon. His hair was originally blue, and blue and red are dominant themes in the colouring throughout. On either side of the Bodhisattva are depicted the Perils, as recounted in the Lotus Sutra and seen in many other paintings from Dunhuang. These scenes are represented with great fidelity to the Perils as described in the verses added at the end of Chapter 25 of the Lotus Sutra. For instance, the scene at the top right illustrates the lines:</p><p>If ...meeting suffering by royal (command)</p><p>His life is to end in execution,</p><p>He thinks of the Cry-Regarder’s power,</p><p>(The executioner’s) sword will break in pieces (kato, 1971, p. 412)</p><p>And the painting shows the sword actually shattering (Pl. 21-4), while, below, to illustrate the lines:</p><p>Though (others) with harmful intent</p><p>Throw him into a burning pit,</p><p>Let him think of the Cry-Regarder’s power,</p><p>And the fire-pit will become a pool (ibid., p. 411)</p><p>The pool is shown in such a way that it is clear that the burning figure will be immediately quenched in it.</p><p>The costumes of the male figures in these scenes, with their limp cap ribbons (quite different from those of the donors below), lead one to imagine that this painting was fairly closely modeled on an early ninth century prototype, but decorative details such as the flower in a bowl in front of the Bodhisattva (Pl.21-5), and the triple-flowered canopy above, are clearly of the mid-tenth century.</p><p>The donor is in fact the smaller figure on the right, a soldier dedicating this painting on behalf of his deceased parents. Clearly, the Perils from which Avalokitesvara was the saviour were not merely those of this life: those of the next world weighed greatly on the donor’s mind. This must be the explanation for the two attendants standing beneath the lotus pedestal: although they are not labeled, the fact that they hold scrolls suggests that they are the Good and Bad Boys, the recorders of good and evil. In Pl. 27, a similar pair of figures is actually so identified.</p></note></msItem><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>五代時期,10世紀中葉</p><p>絹本設色</p><p>高86.1釐米 寬54.0釐米</p><p>斯坦因繪畫28.Ch.lvii.001</p><p>本畫原來的整個背景都塗了美麗的綠色，左右對稱的長方形題箋框也用了各種顔色，是件華麗的作品，而最初應該還要鮮豔。中央是四臂觀世音菩薩，以半跏趺姿勢坐在六角形祭壇上的蓮華座上，上方的兩手捧著日月。頭髮當初可能是青色的，色彩是以青和紅色爲主調貫穿全身。</p><p>觀音的兩旁，畫的是在敦煌出土的其他繪畫中也多見的，《法華經》中講的表示危難的圖。這些極忠實地描繪了加寫在《法華經》第二十五品《觀世音菩薩普門品》後的偈頌中所記的危難。如右上圖（圖21－4）中，就是基於“或遭王難苦  臨刑欲壽終  念彼觀音力  刀尋段段壞”，描繪刑吏的手將要行刑時，只要心中念觀音，劍節節折斷的樣子。其下面的是根據“假使興害意  推落大火坑 念彼觀音力  火坑變成池”，描繪有惡意的人即使想殺人，把人推進大火坑，只要心中念觀音，火坑立刻會變成水池等畫面。從这些危難圖中出現的男人（參照圖21－3）頭戴軟腳襆頭（和下欄中硬腳幡頭的供養人像完全不同）看，這些圖不是非常忠實地模寫了9世紀初的情況嗎？但是，另一方面，放在觀音前的盤中生出的花（參照圖21－5）以及上方三個花連接的華蓋等裝飾性的描繪，明顯是10世紀中葉的作品。</p><p>供養人是下段右端小型的男子像，他是士兵，爲亡父母捐獻的畫。因此，這供養人的意圖中，請求觀音解救今世于危難，沒有解救來世于危難強烈。從中尊台座兩旁站立的兩個童子也可以瞭解這種思想。雖未附像名，但從他們持的卷狀物品可以明白，是善、惡的記錄者，即善童子和惡童子。圖27的《觀世音菩薩圖》中可見相同的兩像，記錄著各自的名字。</p></note></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 22"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.19</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Ksitigarbha as Lord of the Six Ways</title><title lang="chi-Hant">地藏菩薩圖</title><note lang="eng"><p>Northern Song dynasty, dated 4th year of Jianlong 建隆四年(A.D.963)</p><p>Ink and colours on silk</p><p>Painted area: H. 56.1 cm, W. 51.5 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting 19. Ch.lviii.003</p><p>See also Figs. 25-27</p><p>Among the paintings of the Stein collection, the Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha has already been seen represented alone, both on silk banners (Vol. 1, Pls. 44, 45; also Fig. 93), and in a small uninscribed votive painting of the early tenth century (Pl.8). His increased popularity later in the same century is attested by the three paintings shown here (Pls. 22-24), as well as by numerous paintings in the Pelliot collection also. In a recent paper, Lothar Ledderose (1981) has shown how simple depictions of Ksitigarbha alone may have developed towards a more complex organisation, in which the Bodhisattva is show first with the Ten Kings of Hell, who eventually gain independence, as in the handscrolls seen in Pls. 63 and 64 where they have become the main subject. The present paintings (Pls. 22-24) are accordingly shown as possible stages in this development. (For a thorough study of the cult of Ksitigarbha, with especial reference to Korea, see the doctoral thesis by Youngsook Pak, University of Heidelberg. 1981.)</p><p>In the upper part of the painting, Ksitigarbha, attended by two Bodhisattvas, is shown as Lord of the Six Gati. Each of the Six Ways is represented by a small figure placed next to a striped band. The Way of Devas is shown as a small Bodhisattva, top left; the remaining five are those of Animals (a horse and an ox), of Hell (a demon with a pitchfork; Fig.25), and on the right, the Way of Men, the Way of Asura (a four-armed deity holding the sun and moon), and the Way of Hungry Ghosts (a figure among flames; Fig. 26).

His body lodges in the House of Fire and he fears to fall in the Five Evil Ways. Fortune and disaster are inconstant; his heart longs to be among the ranks of the emancipated. Now he is again attacked by sickness and pain and cannot obtain relief. He desires that his small afflictions should rapidly retreat from his body and all misery from his constitution. May his merit cause (Ksitigarbha’s) staff to shake so that in Hell lotus buds grow; and may his radiant gem shine forth in the Dark Ways, till they be turned into the semblance of the Pure Land. Also he desires that his parents and relations by marriage and all his connexions may rest in health and security and that his brothers, cousins, and all the collateral branches of his family may be moistened with the dew of a prosperous portion. (Translation adapted from Waley.)</p><p>Here, as in the painting itself, it is only Ksitigarbha who is invoked, through the mention of his chief attributes, the khakkhara (staff) and the cintamani (radiant gem). Ksitigarbha’s special vow to rescue souls, even from the regions of hell, offers hope to the donor not only for himself but on behalf of his whole house-hold. In the paintings that follow, the role of the Ten Kings in deciding the future of the soul appears alongside that of Ksitigarbha and assumes a growing importance.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>北宋時代，建隆四年（963年）題記</p><p>絹本設色</p><p>圖案部分：高56.1釐米 寬51.5釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫19.Ch.lviii.003</p><p>參照Figs.25-27</p><p>被斯坦因收集的地藏菩薩繪畫，曾介紹過以獨立像出現的絹繪幡畫（參照第1卷圖44、45，Fig.93），以及認爲是10世紀初的沒有紀年的被帽地藏菩薩像（參照圖8）等。到了10世紀後半葉，地藏菩薩的信仰更加高漲，這一情況，除了本圖和接着它的兩個圖外，还可在伯希和收集品中，多見同一時期的地藏繪畫等得到證實。</p><p>最近，Lothar Ledderose教授發表論文指出，地藏繪畫經曆了從獨立的像到由冥府十王伴隨的複雜構成發展過程。根據他的論文，冥府十王最初是作爲陪同地藏菩薩而出現，以後如在圖63及64的畫卷中所見的那樣，逐漸變成每個都獨立描繪的形式。從本圖至圖24的三圖中，可窺見這一發展階段之一端。地藏信仰的全部經過，尤其是要與韓國的進行比較，則需要參考在海德堡大學提交的朴英淑女士的博士論文。</p><p>畫面上段，是作爲六道救濟者的地藏伴随的兩個菩薩。六道是用各自細小的道上配上象徵性的小像來表示，左方最上段的小菩薩像代表天道，其下的二道是畜生道（用牛馬來表示）和地獄道（用拿著耙子的鬼來表示）（參照Fig.25）。右邊從上方開始分別描繪的是人道、阿修羅道（以捧日月的四臂天部來表現）、餓鬼道（用被火焰包圍的像來表示）（參照Fig.26）。</p><p>此畫的供養人是敦煌的康清奴，此時祈願除天道外的五道的解救，題記中這樣寫道（行是從左往右。參照Fig.27）：</p><p>建隆四年癸亥歲五月廿二日題記</p><p>親姻眷屬並休康寧昆季枝羅同霑福分</p><p>錫振動地獄生蓮珠耀迷途還同淨土更願</p><p>速退於身軀煩惱永離於原體功德乃金</p><p>之刃今者更染患疾未得痊#願微痾</p><p>宅恐墮於五趣之中禍福無常心願於解脫</p><p>其斯繪者厥有清信弟子康清奴身居火</p><p>題記大意是：此繪畫的施主是清信弟子康清奴，唯恐墮入火宅五惡道。此世間禍福皆無常，渴望心靈的解脫。現今，再度受病魔之襲擾，得不到痊愈。祈願這小小的不幸速離身軀，所有的煩惱永遠消失。地藏具有錫杖一振，使地獄生蓮花，用寶珠使黑暗道變成明亮的功德，還歸淨土，並啓願雙親和姻戚及其他有關係的人都得到健康安寧，一族都在沐浴於順調的恩惠之中（採用Waley的譯文）。</p><p>這裏，祈願地藏通過錫杖和寶珠授予功德，畫面中也只有攜帶那些物品的地藏菩薩被描繪得非常大。而解救靈魂的地藏的功德延續到冥界，不單是供養著本人，連同相關人的期望都會得到實現。因此，到了下一階段，裁定死者在何界轉生的冥府十王與地藏一同出現，從此，十王的重要性逐漸增強。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 23"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.9</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Ksitigarbha with the Ten Kings of Hell</title><title lang="chi-Hant">地藏十王圖</title><note lang="eng"><p>Five Dynasties, mid-10th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours and gold on silk</p><p>H.48.1 cm, W.44.1 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting 9.

Yama, the fifth king, is at the lower left, wearing the mian, while the others wear civilian caps, or a kind of winged cap, or, in the case of the figure at top right, full armour with a helmet.

Further gruesome details are added in the hand-scrolls illustrating the sutra on paper (Pls. 63, 64), where Ksitigarbha is no longer the central figure.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>五代時期,10世紀中葉</p><p>絹本設色</p><p>圖案部分：高91.0釐米 寬65.5釐米</p><p>斯坦因繪畫23.Ch.0021</p><p>參照Figs.33、34</p><p>此圖與上圖是同一主題的作品，但表現了更多的細節，在圖像方面也進了一步。地藏手持錫杖和寶珠，以半跏趺姿態坐在畫面中央的岩座上，兩側圍繞著十王。十王像現在的審判長，每人都坐在桌子後邊。第五王閻魔王出現在畫面左下邊，頭戴冕冠，不同于其他王的文官頭巾或兩翼伸長的冠，或畫面右上角一身像戴的兜鍪。每個王前的案子上都展開卷物，放著硯臺，並且都帶有侍者（參照Fig.33、34）。</p><p>下方除了道明和獅子外，還繪有手持大棒的牛頭獄吏，牽著帶枷的男子，他在看鏡子裏映出的前世犯下的殺牛罪惡（參照Fig.24－3）。</p><p>這裏表現亡靈在死後的第七日接受第一王的審判，其後一直到四十九天，都是每隔七天，以後還要接連不斷地接受十王第一百日、一年、三年等的審判，以及考察前世所犯罪惡的懲罰（通過行好事來減免罪惡）等。在圖63、64的畫卷中，對接受十王審判的亡靈的描繪多起來。那裏，地藏已經不是主角了。</p><p>榜題框是空欄，此畫大概沒有被實際使用，因此保存狀態非常好，深紫色的絹邊也完全保留下來。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 25"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.24</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Avalokitesvara as Saviour from Perils</title><title lang="chi-Hant">法華經普門品變相圖</title><note lang="eng"><p>Northern Song dynasty, dated 4th year of Jianlong 建隆 （A.D. 963）</p><p>Ink and colours on silk</p><p>H.107.0 cm, W.61.5 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting 24. Ch. xxi.001</p><p>See also Fig.28</p><p>This is an interesting and well-painted work with some unusual features considering its late date. Avalokitesvara, standing in the centre, is reminiscent of scenes of the Buddha preaching at the Vulture Peak, by reason of the large almond-shaped aureole. Its strong banding of green, red, yellow and blue, without other decorative designs, contains and unifies the figure and its flowing scarves. Avalokitesvara holds a sprinkler vase in his left hand, while his right holds a lotus stem crowned by the “parent” figure of Amitabha. This figure is thus given special prominence, by appearing to one side instead of centrally in the headdress. The headdress itself has red, purple and blue flowers among the gold-coloured ornament, and upward-fluttering ribbons. The outer ring of the halo is rich purple with flames drawn in ink.</p><p>This richness and variety is continued in the top part of the painting where apsarasas scattering flowers and incense (Pl. 25-2) are seen in varied attitudes on either side of the elaborate canopy, with long scarves floating in graceful curves. Below, on either side of main figure, the various Perils illustrated also seem to display rather more originality than those of, for instance, Pl. 18. At the top left, a man is seen being chased by an armoured rider with a sword; a figure is seen drowning; a lady in flowered red trousers is fleeing from a wolf; and a man in a purple jacket is being pursued by a lean yellow leopard.</p><p>From the top right are a man in stocks; a man fleeing with a camel (perhaps this is a variant of the storm theme seen in other paintings); and finally a boy in a mauve flowered jacket, set upon by a bearded man with a sword (Pl. 25-3). These seven scenes are all set in a fairly simple landscape of red and green (which has generally corroded the silk), with spindly trees indicated in ink on the skylines, and other sparse vegetation. Unlike the lively interest of the figures, this landscape is unmistakably tenth century in character, as of course are the donor figures below, joined by a small child next to the central inscription (Fig.28).</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>北宋時期，建隆四年（963年）題記</p><p>絹本設色</p><p>高107.0釐米 寬61.5釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫24.Ch.xxi.001</p><p>參照Fig.28</p><p>本畫描摹精致，它所具有的一些宋代畫中少見的特點也頗引人注意。站在中央的觀音，被杏仁形的大型身光環繞，使人想起《靈鷲山釋迦說法圖》。其身光只以明快的綠、紅、黃、青色的帶構成，沒有其他裝飾花紋，佛像和天衣完全被圍在裏面。觀音左手提淨瓶，右手持頂上有化佛的蓮莖。因此化佛沒有出在寶冠中央，卻出現在靠近一側的位置上，是此像極爲特殊的地方。頭上有金色的寶冠和向上方飄揚的彩帶，其間裝飾有紅、紫、青等色的花。頭光最外側的圓是深紫色的，其上有墨描的火焰紋。</p><p>如此複雜細緻富於變化的表現，在畫面上部也可見到。在那裏，精巧描繪的華蓋兩側，有散花的飛天和持香爐的飛天，他們形態各異，長長的天衣在空中呈現出美麗的曲線。其下方主尊的兩旁，畫著種種危難的圖，它們與圖18中的危難圖等相比，則可以說是非常接近經典的描繪。</p><p>左側的上部，有身穿鎧甲的騎馬武士，揮刀追趕一個男子，其下方連著表現的是溺水的人物。還有穿紅花褲子的女人被狼追趕，接著是穿紫色上衣的男子被瘦弱的黃色豹追趕等場面。右側從上方開始，是帶枷和腳銬的男子、牽著駱駝逃離的男子（這也可能是其他作品中暴雨主題的變形）、身穿淡紫色花衣的少年被有鬍鬚的持刀男人追趕等場面（參照圖25－3）。</p><p>此七個場景，是在天際線上只用墨線描繪的細長樹木，其它草地用紅色和綠色（此顔料一般會腐蝕絹底），描繪簡單的山水畫中展現的。除了人物表現生動這一點外，山水的表現、下段的供養人像、題記旁邊的童子像，的確像是10世紀的表現風格。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 26"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.52</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="san-Latn">Avalokitesvara with donors</title><title lang="chi-Hant">觀世音菩薩像</title><note lang="eng"><p>Northern Song dynasty, dated 4th (recte 5th)year of Kaibao,renshen （A.D. 972）</p><p>Ink and colours on silk</p><p>H.103.0 cm, W.69.0 cm (including border)</p><p>Painted area: H. 91.5 cm, W.59.1 cm</p><p>Stein painting 52. Ch. 00167</p><p>See also Fig.35</p><p>Many features typify this small votive painting as characteristic of late tenth century Buddhist art at Dunhuang. The viewer is at once aware of the bright colouring, in which green and orange tones predominate, and of the prominence of the donors below, all identically apparelled. Both features immediately recall the wall paintings of many of the tenth century caves at Dunhuang, where pale green is often the prevailing tone, and rows of donors, almost life-sized, parade around the walls (e.g., Cave 61; Dunhuang bihua, Pl. 204). In this painting, the men stand on a fringed carpet; the ladies opposite wear elaborate headdresses with hairpins and bright yellow ornaments (intended to be golden). The edges of their sleeves reveal embroidered floral patterns.</p><p>Despite the lavish ornamentation, however, the actual execution of the painting reveals the simplified approach due to the comparative isolation of Dunhuang at this time. Little room is left for the eight Bodhisattvas surrounding Avalokitesvara; even the altar cloth, with “Praise to the Bodhisattva Guanyin” written on it, has no lower border, and the last two characters have had to be fitted in as best they may since the writer failed to judge the space correctly.</p><p>The dated inscription (Fig. 35), which is presented as though written on a stone tablet, appears to reflect the predominant importance of the donors. Its wishes refer only to the family of the chief donor, Zhang Keqiao, captain of infantry troops. The cyclical year renshen in actual fact corresponds to the fifth year of the Kaibao reign, rather than the fourth as written here: as Waley pointed out, the cyclical date (A. D.972) is likely to be the correct one.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>北宋時期，開寶四年壬申（正確的是同年號五年：972年）題記</p><p>絹本設色</p><p>整體（含邊）：高103.0釐米 寬69.0釐米</p><p>圖樣部分：高91.5釐米 寬59.1釐米</p><p>斯坦因繪畫52.Ch.00167</p><p>參照Figs.35</p><p>此小型供養畫，多方面體現了敦煌10世紀後期佛教美術的特點。看到此繪畫時，首先引起注意的是綠和橙色爲主調的明亮的配色，以及下欄出現的同一姿態的男女供養人像。這些特色直接讓人想起敦煌石窟10世紀的大多數壁畫。可是壁畫中淡綠色爲主調的場景比較多，供養人像幾乎是等身大，排列在牆壁的周圍（如參照第61窟：《敦煌壁畫》圖版204）。此絹畫中，男人像並排站在有裝飾邊的墊上，對面的女人像可見帶著鮮黃色（用以代表金飾）的頭飾和簪子的豪華髮型。兩者的衣物袖口都有刺繡的花紋。</p><p>儘管用奢侈的裝飾物來表現，但此畫的描繪能反映當時敦煌陷入相當孤立狀態的背景，其表現有傾向簡單化的感覺。只留給簇擁觀音的八菩薩一小部分空間，寫有“南無觀音菩薩”的祭壇挂布下端也被省略。而且在挂布上記錄文字時，沒有充分考慮文字的分配，最後兩個字，即“菩”和“薩”未能很好的納入裏邊。</p><p>含有紀年的題記（參照Fig.35），收納在石碑形框中，大概是尊重供養人的意向，採取的特殊處理。那裏記錄的祈願文是專對供養人所代表的步兵隊長張擖橋家族的。干支壬申，事實上不是這裏所寫的開寶四年，而是指同年號的五年。正如Waley指出，取干支“壬申”（972年）比年號更準確。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 27"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.54</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Avalokitesvara with donors</title><title lang="chi-Hant">觀世音菩薩像</title><note lang="eng"><p>Northern Song dynasty, dated 8th year of Taipingxingguo 太平興國（A.D. 983）</p><p>Ink and colours on silk</p><p>H.102.0 cm, W.75.5 cm (including border)</p><p>Painted area: H. 99.0 cm, W.59.5 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting 54.

According to the cartouche in the upper left corner and judging by the “parent” figure of Amitabha in the headdress, the central figure is Avalokitesvara. This ever-popular Bodhisattva has here, however, assumed some features more properly associated with Ksitigarbha, who, as we have seen (Pls. 22-24), enjoyed considerable popularity in the tenth century. Thus in his left hand Avalokitesvara is holding the cintamani, while on either side he is accompanied by standing figures of the Good and Bad Boys, each holding a large scroll. These are the spirits who keep records and at regular intervals ascend to make reports that will be used after death when the soul appears before the Ten Kings for judgement of its actions during life, and a decision on the sphere in which it will be reborn.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>北宋時期，太平興國八年（983年）題記</p><p>絹本設色</p><p>整體（含邊）：高102.0釐米 寬75.5釐米</p><p>圖樣部分：高99.0釐米 寬59.5釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫54.Ch.lvii.004</p><p>參照Fig.36</p><p>此畫除了是有紀年的作品外，有幾處改變很值得注意。用新的日本紙做裏子，加了新的竹竿和卷軸，使用的各種色布的邊仍以原來的樣子保存下來，畫的四邊各縫進1釐米。</p><p>色彩的使用方法、供養人的突出，頭光和身光的結構和配色等，可看出與上一圖（圖26）有密切關連。根據畫面左上角長方形題箋中記錄的像名和寶冠上的化佛，知道中尊是觀世音菩薩。但是，通常人氣很高的觀音，在這裏，使人聯想起曾在圖22～24中，10世紀時深受歡迎的地藏菩薩具有的幾個特徵。那是因觀音左手持火焰寶珠，兩旁跟隨著懷抱很大卷物的善童子和惡童子的原因。這兩個童子的作用，是獲得記錄後在一定時間內作出報告書。死者因生前的行爲，出現在十王面前而受審判時，根據那報告書判斷他將轉生於哪一界。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 28-1"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.68</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Illustrations to the Fumu Enzhong Jing 父母恩重經</title><title lang="chi-Hant">水月觀音圖</title><note lang="eng"><p>Northern Song dynasty, late 10th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on silk</p><p>H.134.0 cm, W.102.0 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting 67 、68.

Behind this main group are two of the Four Guardian Kings, while in front are four more Bodhisattvas with offerings of flowers. The next section of the painting identifies the whole, for it consists of scenes illustrating the Fumu enzhong jing, an apocryphal sutra popular at Dunhuang in the Five Dynasties and early Song. Eiichi Matsumoto has shown (1937, pp. 196-200) how the texts in the cartouches accompanying each scene correspond almost exactly to this text as preserved among the Stein manuscripts from Dunhuang. The mountains above the main Buddha group must therefore be Mt. Grdhrakuta 耆阇崛山, which features at the beginning of the sutra as its setting.</p><p>Because the sutra deals with the blessings received from one’s parents, the figures in these small scenes correspond precisely to donor figures of the period. On the right, a boy is shown receiving instruction from his father, and there is a baby in the arms of its mother (Pl. 28-3). The relevant text is that in the cartouche to the left of the scene: “Father and mother cherish and hold him making gentle sounds; he smiles but cannot yet speak. When he is hungry and needs to eat, were it not for his mother he would have no food; when he is thirsty and needs to drink, were it not for his mother he would not be given suck.” To the far left, the upper scene illustrates what happens when the son marries and has children of his own: absorbed in private pleasures, no one visits the parents in their old age and failing strength. The central scenes, on either side of a now missing altar, show Ananda, on a lotus seat, and opposite him a devout gentleman, both accompanied by monks, and below by male and female members of the household, all kneeling and with hands clasped. They illustrate the concluding passage of the sutra, originally inscribed on the pink cartouches, in which the Buddha tells Ananda how, by various acts of devotion such as burning incense, making sutras, or giving food and drink to monks, one may requite the blessings received from one’s parents.</p><p>Finally, below these scenes at the bottom of the painting and extensively damaged, some much larger figures are seen. Those nearest the centre and now almost completely destroyed are the deceased father and the mother of the donor, who is identified as a student. But the head of the father (Pl. 28-4) and the whole figure of another lady of the family (Pl. 28-5) remain to bear witness to the fine execution and lavish costume, with carefully applied rouge and beauty spots in the shape of a small bird on the lady’s face, exactly as found in the long lines of lady donors in the wall paintings. Despite the fine detail, however, there is no hint of individual characterization and the donors always remain type figures: they are depicted, in harmony with the intention behind the whole painting, as they would wish to be and not as they really were.</p><p>Before leaving this painting we should note how the organisation of the main Buddha group is typical of the tenth century. By this time the geometric forms of the haloes are very prominent, and the available space is evenly filled by the main figures. The whole group corresponds closely in its proportions to the preaching groups found on the ceiling of the Song dynasty Cave 61 at Dunhuang, and to the stencil (Pl. 78), which was probably used to produce similar preaching groups on other ceilings.</p><p>See also Fig.37。</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>北宋時期,10世紀末</p><p>絹本設色</p><p>高134.0釐米 寬102.0釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫67、68.Ch.lii.004,Ch.lxi.008</p><p>參照Fig.37。</p><p>此畫的上段，描繪的是隨帶阿難、迦葉的釋迦如來和二菩薩（參照圖28－2）。這些主尊的群體背後有四大天王中的兩身，前方有捧花的四身菩薩。中段以圖解《父母恩重經》的場景構成。此《父母恩重經》是自五代起到北宋初期在敦煌深受歡迎的僞經（不在印度本土，而是在中國撰述的佛經）。松本榮一博士在『敦煌畫の研究』（196～200頁）中指出，各場景所附的長方形題箋中的經文，和斯坦因敦煌文書中所見的經文基本一致。從而可認爲主要三尊像上方所繪的山脈，是表現《父母恩重經》開頭設定的耆闍崛山。</p><p>《父母恩重經》是講述人們從父母那里得到的恩惠，将其用圖解的方式表现的各个場面的人物像，与當時畫這人物的供養人像有大致相同。右端場景中，表現少年接受父親的教導的畫面，並加入了懷抱嬰兒的母親（參照圖28－3）。其左側長方形题笺中的“父母懷抱，和和弄聲，含笑未語，饑食須食，非母不哺，渴時須飲，非母不乳”（父母把他抱在懷裏給予爱抚，他只会微笑還不會說話。即使肚子餓了，如果沒有母親則什麽都不能吃，喉咙干了，如果沒有母親，什麽都不能喝），記錄与其場景相当。左端場面的上部，描繪那个孩子結婚後自己有了孩子時的情景。講述孩子們沈浸于自己的歡樂中，誰都沒去探望年老體弱的雙親。曾畫在中央部位的祭壇已經缺失，但其右側描繪坐在蓮華座上的阿難，左側描繪合掌的男子和随帶的衆多僧侶，其下方也繪有合掌下跪的世俗男女。此相當於《父母恩重經》末章的場景，原本為淡紅色的長方形题笺框中記錄着經文，其意爲“釋迦對阿難講，燒香，誦經，爲僧侶布施飲食等，通過種種信仰行爲，人們將回報從父母獲得的恩惠”。</p><p>畫面下端缺損很大，留下來的比中段的人物像還大的供養人像的一部分，从題記得知，供養人是學仕（學生），靠近中心的二像現在幾乎完全遺失的，是供養人的亡父母。從父親的頭部（參照圖28－4）和“女三娘子”的像（參照圖28－5）等殘留的部分可看出，是非常精美的像，特別是像的奢華裝束和臉部的化妝很顯眼。在壁畫中的女供養人像，也常常見到作爲美人斑，在臉頰上用長線描出的靨妝。但在此圖中，婦人像臉頰是紅色，上面还畫了小的鳥形圖樣。然而，儘管細部描繪如此出色，但沒有發現反映人物個性的特徵，結果其表現還是和通常的供養人像毫無差別的模式化。原因是沒有按實際的人物描畫，而是有意識地去和上部整體畫面協調而形成的。</p><p>最後要關注的一點是上段中衆聖簇擁釋迦如來的結構有10世紀的典型特點。此時之前，身光明顯是幾何圖案，主要諸像所佔據的空間也相對均衡。而這種聖衆的組成，與敦煌宋代石窟的第61窟的天井上所描繪的說法圖很接近。圖78的紙樣也與此相近，大概是用於天井說法圖製作中的。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 29"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.63</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Eleven-headed Avalokitesvara</title><title lang="chi-Hant">十一面觀音菩薩圖</title><note lang="eng"><p>Northern Song dynasty, late 10th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on silk</p><p>H.97.0 cm, W.74.3 cm</p><p>Stein painting 63.

Since the closely woven dark blue silk is not at all transparent, the Bodhisattva is represented on the front and the back of the banner in similar but not identical postures. Holding the sun, a disc with a cock depicted in red, in both hands, the Bodhisattva is identified by a cartouche (Pl. 30-2) as 日矅菩薩, Bodhisattva of the Sun, presumably, as suggested by Waley, the same as the Bodhisattva of Sunlight 日光菩薩, one of the two chief attendants on Bhaisajyaguru.</p><p>The figure is confidently drawn in smooth flowing lines of white (for silver), with yellow (for gold) used for the ornaments and patterns on the dress, and red used for the lips as well as for the cock on both sides. The facial features are small in comparison with the full heavy curves of the cheeks but carefully organized. The result gives considerable freedom, for instance in the forms taken by the ends of the scarves, while the painter’s confidence is demonstrated in the different positions of the feet, one foreshortened, the other in profile, both solidly planted on the lotus pedestal rising as a complete flower from the foreground pool (Pl. 30-1).</p><p>A border of lozenges, each with a flower and petalled edges, separates the Bodhisattva from the lower part of the banner, an undivided piece of silk of the same weave and colour but with a repeating pattern of confronting ducks within a flower-and –leaf motif (Pl. 30-3). This too appears to have been drawn freehand rather than stencilled (as suggested by Waley) since there is a considerable amount of variation between front and back, and indeed between repeats on the same side. The weighting board is painted in green and black on a red ground.</p><p>The pattern of confronting ducks is similar to that of a kyokechi-printed textile of the eighth century in the Shoso-in (Matsumoto, 1974, Pl.19), as already noticed by Waley. But the technique alone, apart from this coincidence of motif, recalls other painted works in the Shoso-in, where gold or silver has been used on a darker ground. Although this banner is not alone among those from Dunhuang to adopt this technique (an even larger banner in silver on red damask, featuring a single huge figure over its full length of 386 cm, is shown in Vol. 3), it is possible that its distinctive features indicate that it was made elsewhere. In any case, the international character of Tang style in the eighth century is readily apparent from such comparisons with material far away in Japan.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代,8世紀</p><p>絹本藍底線描（白、黃、赤）</p><p>幡全長：213.0釐米</p><p>圖案部分：高89.6釐米 寬25.5釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫121.Ch.00303</p><p>參照Fig.44.</p><p>本幡保存狀態極好，下端和幡頭還保持著進入藏經洞之前修補的痕跡，其他部分基本完好。使用了深藍色密織的絹，所以無法透過背面看見表面的像，而正反兩面的畫像姿勢與表面的像略有不同。菩薩兩手捧著在圓圈中畫有紅色鳥的日輪，長方形題箋中記有“日曜菩薩”（參照圖30－2），但如Waley所述，可能和藥師如來的兩脅侍之一日光菩薩相同。</p><p>兩面的像都用流暢的白（代替銀）線描繪，衣物的花樣和裝飾品用黃色（代替金），鳥和菩薩的唇用了紅色。眼睛和鼻子比起膨大的臉部，顯得有些小，但描繪得很認真。並且如所見的天衣末端等處，畫面的表現有相當的自由，腳的一隻朝前，另一隻卻是橫向，可感覺到畫家的自信。雙腳穩穩地踏在從前面池中升起的蓮花表示的蓮華座上。</p><p>菩薩像本身和幡的下部之間，用相連的菱形花紋帶區分。構成幡下部的絹織物、顔色和幡本身相同，但沒有通常幡腳那樣的切縫，而是重復描繪有兩隻相對的鴨子環繞在花和葉子中的菱形花紋（參照圖30－3）。這裏大概沒有使用像Waley所說的紙樣，而是手描。因爲表和裏的表現很不同，同一面上也有細微的差別。鎮板紅色底子上，畫了綠和黑色的花紋。</p><p>這種兩隻鴨子相對的構思，Waley曾指出，正倉院收藏的8世紀的夾纈染作品中也見到類似的作品（參照『日本の美術』No.102,松本包夫編『正倉院の染織』圖版19）。另外，除去構思方面的相似之處，從技法的方面講，正倉院裏還有幾件在深底色上用金和銀描繪圖案的作品。敦煌畫中，使用這種技法的作品不僅此一件（第3卷收錄了一件幡，在紅色綾織布上用銀畫著巨大的像，全長達386釐米），但是從像的獨特之處看，這一作品可能是在其他地方製作的。不管怎樣，8世紀的唐樣式，是具有國際性的品格。上述遠方日本留存的可作比較的資料，也是證明。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 31"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.127</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Banner with flying ducks (detail)</title><title lang="chi-Hant">花鳥文幡（局部）</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 8th century A.D.</p><p>Silver on silk</p><p>Total length 131.0 cm</p><p>Painted area: H. 43.8 cm, W.14.2 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting 127.

It recalls a series of three banners, somewhat larger in size, in the Pelliot collection (Bannières, Nos. 205, 212, 213). One of these shows a kalavinka playing a pipa; the other two each have a small bird carrying a large spray of leaves and flowers. The Pelliot banners are all preserved complete with headpieces, side streamers, damask tail streamers painted with floral motifs, and weighting boards. With the present banner the side streamers are missing, and unfortunately the weighting board, of layers of woolen material covered with gauze and lacquered, is no longer preserved with the painting; but the headpiece is complete, and the four tail streamers almost complete, though very fragile. They are on a complex alternating gauze and are painted with small floral motifs in an opaque pigment, probably including some silver as in the main part of the banner.</p><p>It has been suggested by Waley that this was a marriage banner, but if we consider it together with the banners in the Pelliot collection, showing the musician kalavinka and song birds, it seems more probable that these are all intended to show the birds and musicians dwelling in the Western Paradise (see the note on kalavinka following the notes to Vol. 1, Pl. 9). A date in the ninth century, or earlier, has been proposed for the Pelliot banners and seems reasonable in view of the confident, relaxed curves of the brushwork, as well as the materials composing the banner, with the silk headpiece painted in bright colours, a piece of printed silk serving as a hanging loop, and two bamboo stiffeners wound first with raw white silk and then diagonally with coloured silk. The classic scroll at the bottom of the painted panel also suggests a late eighth century date, since the motifs within each wave of the scroll are not yet elaborated into a complete flower or leaf (personal communication from Jessica Rawson).</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代,8世紀</p><p>絹本褐色底線描（銀泥）</p><p>幡全長：131.0釐米</p><p>圖案部分：高43.8釐米 寬14.2釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫127.Ch.0024</p><p>參照Fig.45.</p><p>此幡的圖案是用銀泥描繪，銀由於變色而發黑，但其金屬的光澤仍保留至今。在伯希和收集品中也見到三件尺寸稍大，與此有相同趣味的幡（參照伯希和圖錄《敦煌幡和繪畫》篇圖版205、212、213）。其中一件是演奏琵琶的迦陵頻伽，另外兩件上畫著銜巨大花枝的小鳥，三件都有幡頭、兩側的幡尾、繪有花紋的綾織幡腳、鎮板等，全都很完整。而本圖的幡，則缺兩側的幡尾，在紗包覆蓋的毛織布上塗漆而成的鎮板也已掉下。幡頭很完整，四根幡腳雖變得很脆弱，但保留也大致完整。幡腳用紋紗，用不透明的顔料繪著小的花紋。在那顔料裏，大概含有繪幡主體使用的銀泥。</p><p>Waley曾認爲此幡是結婚儀式上用的，但綜合伯希和收集品中繪著迦陵頻伽和小鳥的幡畫考慮，則看作是欲表現棲息於西方淨土的靈鳥更爲合適（參看第一卷圖9對迦陵頻伽的註釋）。伯希和收集品中的幡，相當於9世紀或者8世紀末的作品，此幡也大概是同一時代的作品。那是因它具備的舒展而無停頓的曲線和幡的材質，幡頭色彩明亮，吊環使用的印染絹。還有包著兩根竹芯的白色生絹，及上面像斜格子一樣纏的染色絹等。再，表現在此圖主體下端的古風的唐草文樣，花和葉子的形狀還不夠精致，認爲它是8世紀末的更爲妥當（根據與Jessica Rawson女士的私人交流）。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 32"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.216</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Long banner of Bodhisattvas (detail)</title><title lang="chi-Hant">菩薩像長幡（部分）</title><note lang="eng"><p>Five Dynasties, dated 3rd year of Xiande 顯德三年（A.D. 956）</p><p>Ink and colours on silk</p><p>Total length 396.0 cm</p><p>Dimensions of detail shown: H.85.0 cm, W.59.0 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting 216.

One such, of a single, large than life-size Bodhisattva, has already been mentioned in the entry to Pl. 30 and appears in Vol. 3. The rest display not single figures, but series of Bodhisattvas or Buddhas, seated or standing, in almost identical representations arranged one above another. The majority are executed in brush outlines only, with little by way of modelling and little or no colouring. Instead, colourful effects were obtained by the use of colour in the silk material itself and for the outlines of the figures. Several combinations were therefore possible: one, of white outlines on dark blue, has already been seen in Pl. 30; another, of silver on red, was chosen for the large banner of Vol. 3. Other combinations can be seen in this plate and those that follow: red on yellow (Pls. 32, 33); yellow on blue (Pls. 34,35); and ink on yellow (Pls.36, 37).</p><p>Although these banners are in no way narrative in content, their function has been clearly identified in connection with the cult of Bhaisajyaguru, the Medicine Buddha. The passage in question, from a section of the earliest Bhaisajyaguru sutra in a work called the Guanding jing 灌頂經, has been translated by Alexander Soper:</p><p lang="chi-Hant">若族姓男女其有尩臝。著床痛惱無救諸者、……四十九遍讀是經典、勸然七層之燈、亦勤懸五色續命神幡……神幡五色四十九尺… ……七層之燈一層七燈、燈如車輸、若遭厄難閉在牢獄枷鎖著身、亦應造立五色神幡然四十九燈……</p><p>The inscription (Fig. 47), which runs in bold if somewhat erratic running characters across the top of the present banner, immediately brings the above passage to mind (translation adapted from Waley):</p><p>...

The date, just before the establishment of the Song dynasty (A.D. 960), is of great use in helping to date other similar banners. The banner itself, perhaps because of its great size, does not have the typical triangular headpiece of the smaller banners: instead the inscription forms a rectangular panel stretching across the top, and the remainder of the banner is formed of a single width of silk, but split down the centre to form two narrower strips (Fig. 46).</p><p>Nine Bodhisattvas, all forms of Avalokitesvara, and five of them still identified with individual names, are shown on these two strips. They are painted in clear colour washes, mainly red, but occasionally with areas of pale blue, yellow or green, with the outlines picked out in a brighter red, and with occasional use of ink. The same technique and similar colouring seem to have been used on a narrower long banner (H. 303 cm, W. 21 cm) in the Pelliot collection, featuring five apsarasas flying or playing musical instruments (Bannières, No. 204). But it is clear that more than nine Bodhisattvas in all were originally shown on the double strip below the inscription. A new length can be seen to have been sewn on at the bottom of the left strip (Fig. 46), and as we have seen in the inscription the original length of the whole banner was intended to be forty-nine feet. Part of this further length can be identified. A series of three figures (two more Bodhisattvas and the disciple Ananda) (Fig. 48) on the same silk were noted by Waley as a continuation of this banner, and two details are shown in Pl. 33, showing the same hand in the inscriptions and the same pale blue wash used for the hair of the figures. This additional length, from the left side only, is very slightly narrower but has the same selvedge characteristics as the lower end of the top part, where a new length is sewn on. It ends with a portrait of the donor and two smaller figures, no doubt originally matched by that of his wife and her attendants on the opposite strip, now missing. Just as the total length may still have fallen short of the notional forty-nine feet, we may be sure the donor did not have the banner painted with his own blood, as claimed in the inscription: the red pigment used was probably a local red earth, tuhong 土紅 for the washes and cinnabar, zhu 朱 for the brighter outlines. Hanging a banner of this length would have presented no problems at Dunhuang, for example outside on the cliff face or inside a cave such as Cave 130, which shelters a twenty-six metre figure of the Buddha Amitabha from the eighth century.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>五代時期，顯德三年（956年）</p><p>絹本設色</p><p>幡全長：341.0釐米</p><p>圖版部分：（33－1）高49.5釐米 寬28.5釐米,（33－2）高37.9釐米 寬28.5釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫196.Ch.xxiv.008.a</p><p>參照Fig.48.</p><p>無論在斯坦因收集品中，還是在伯希和收集品中，都有相當數量的非常長的幡畫。其中有一件繪有一身巨大菩薩像的作品，收錄在第3卷中，曾在圖30的解說中提到過它。其他的幡畫不是獨立的巨像，而是或坐或立的佛像、菩薩像，幾乎以同樣的表現方式縱向連接的作品。大部分只用線描勾勒，沒有質感的表現，也很少或完全沒有色彩。這些主要是想通過絹的底色和線描的顔色來提高色彩的效果，通過幾個的組合可以想象出。一個是深藍色底子上用白線描的組合，前邊在圖30中所見的作品屬這一組。其次是紅色底子上用銀線描的組合，與此相似的長幡收錄在第3卷裏。圖32～37所刊載的，是黃色底子上用紅色、藍色底子上用黃色、黃色底子上用墨色等。</p><p>這些幡中所繪的畫，不是圖解故事，但是與藥師信仰有關係的作品。在名為《灌頂經》的最早的《藥師經》中，可見到這樣一節记述：</p><p>圖32的長幡中，也可见到記着與此有關的題記（參照Fig.47）。題記大膽採用奇特的書體，從左向右豎寫，錄文如下：</p><p>時大周顯德三年比妻男同霑福祐于父母長報安康在花顔永茂次爲原中比滄溟夫人延遐令公壽同山嶽祿飛鳩西□綵□願□□宛轉飄飄似龍鈎高曳直至於九尺飜壹條其飜乃任延朝刻□敬畫四十史大夫上柱國西河郡大夫檢校工部尚書兼御…………使銀青光祿……歸義軍節度內□</p><p>從這題記中，不僅看出與前面所引的《灌頂經》的一節有關的記錄，還能反映在与父母居住的中原經常中斷通信的邊遠地區，在敦煌生活的供養人的真實生活。另外，紀年的顯德三年（956年），正值宋王朝成立（960年）之前，這也爲考證其他長幡的年代提供了一個大致的標準。此幡也許尺寸過大，沒有像小型幡那样的三角形幡頭。代替它的是，在用一幅絹製作的此幡上端，留出了長方形的空間，在那裏寫入題記。其下方的中心有切縫，成了兩根細长片（參照Fig.46）。</p><p>此幡中所畫的九身菩薩均是觀音菩薩，其中五身像名可確認。各像塗著淡淡的筆彩，大部分是紅色，個別也使用了淡青、黃、綠色。輪廓線用亮紅色勾出，一部分也用了墨線。在伯希和收集品中有使用同樣描法和色彩的長幡（高303釐米，寬21釐米。參照伯希和圖錄《敦煌幡和繪畫》篇圖版204），那裏還描繪有空中飛翔彈奏樂器的五身飛天。</p><p>然而，除了現在保留下來的九身外，此幡當初在題記下方還繪著其他幾身像。從現存部分的左側下端的狀態看（參照Fig.46），顯然其下還曾縫有其他絹，正像題記中所記述的，有意製作一件全長四十九尺的幡。下邊所續接的，有一部分得到了證實。</p><p>圖33所載的二菩薩正中間，夾著阿難陀的像，他們被描在縱排的幡上（參照Fig.48），但Waley曾認爲，從長方形題箋中所記文字的書體，以及頭髮上塗淡青色的手法看，可以成爲此幡的連續部分。圖33的幡應連接圖32幡的左下，雖然幅寬稍窄，但其織邊上出現了與圖32的幡下端縫製的絹相同的特徵。下端繪男供養人像和兩個童子，當時，對面應該繪他的夫人和侍女。加了這些，全長也遠不到四十九尺，並且也見不到題記中所記述的供養人一族的身影。</p><p>這裏使用的紅色顔料大概是紅土，暈色是土紅色，而明亮的輪廓線則用朱紅。在敦煌懸挂如此長的幡不成問題，可以懸挂在山崖上或者可以在第130窟這樣的8世紀大窟內，那裏安置著高有26米的阿彌陀像。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 34"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.214.1</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Long banner of Bodhisattvas (detail)</title><title lang="chi-Hant">花鳥文幡（局部）</title><note lang="eng"><p>Five Dynasties, mid-10th century A.D.</p><p>Colour on silk</p><p>Total length 339.0 cm</p><p>Dimensions of detail shown: H. 72.8 cm, W.30.0 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting 214(1).

A single Bodhisattva in gold on blue paper, thought perhaps to be the frontispiece to a sutra, is in the Pelliot collection (Bannières, No. 183) but is very much smaller, as well as being more carefully drawn than those done in yellow on silk.</p><p>The width of silk used strongly suggests that, like the dated banner of the preceding plate, these two strips originally hung side by side as a very long banner joined at the top. This would seem to be confirmed since a banner in the Pelliot collection (Bannières, No. 182) in the same technique still has the two strips side by side, with a single figure of a standing Bodhisattva spanning the whole width of both strips at the top. That banner is at present 580 cm long, but a further single strip in Paris (Bannières, No. 182 bis) is 800 cm long, roughly the same as the combined lengths of the two strips shown here. Given the close similarities of silk width, colour and line between all these fragments, it seems entirely possible that they all form part of a single banner some fourteen metres or more in length. This length of fourteen metres, or forty-five and a half feet, comes remarkably close, allowing for minor losses and breaks, to the “forty-nine” feet given as the length of the inscribed banner in the preceding plate.</p><p>A fragment of another banner in yellow on blue is also in the Stein collection (Fig. 76). It has two sections sewn together: the upper part of pale blue and the lower of dark blue silk.

I hesitate to conclude that a reed pen or a wooden pen was used because the instrument was capable of a fair degree of modulation in line thickness.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>五代時期，顯德三年（956年）</p><p>絹本黃底線描（墨）</p><p>幡全長：835.0釐米</p><p>圖版部分：高74.7釐米 寬28.0釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫205.Ch.00474</p><p>參照Fig.52.</p><p>此幡相當於上述圖32解說中第三組的作品，黃色底上用墨繪菩薩像。上端縫有紅色窄絹布，其下和最上部的菩薩像（共有九身菩薩像）之間插入了大的花卉紋。</p><p>九身菩薩，是以略帶抖動的快速筆法描繪的，長方形題箋中記有各像的尊名。有三、四身像的軀幹和腰周圍可見三條水平印痕，這也許是製作時使用的案子表面不平，而出現的接口。從線的特徵和這些印痕看，使用了相對較硬的筆。雖然不能明確斷定，但從線的粗細和抑揚看，可能是蘆筆或者木筆。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 37"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.195</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Long banner of seated Buddhas (detail)</title><title lang="chi-Hant">菩薩像長幡（局部）</title><note lang="eng"><p>Five Dynasties, mid-10th century A.D.</p><p>Ink on silk</p><p>Total length 538.0 cm</p><p>Dimensions of detail shown: H. 57.3 cm, W.18.0 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting 195.

Ch. xxii. 0017</p><p>See also Figs. 53,54</p><p>Despite the very considerable damage and loss of pigment, enough remains of this painting on hemp cloth to show it to have been a beautiful work (see also Fig. 53). In style and execution it is very similar to the mandala of Amoghapasa in the Pelliot collection (Bannieres, No. 86), and must, like that work, date from the period of Tibetan control at Dunhuang or earlier. The plain background was originally turquoise or blue as in the Amoghapasa mandala, and the delicacy of the modelling also recalls that painting.</p><p>Avalokitesvara, in the centre, is seated with right hand in vara-mudra. Since nearly all the surface colour has been lost, the extreme delicacy of the initial drawing in ink is clearly visible, especially in the face. The very narrow scarves that he wears were originally ornamented with spots of opaque white pigment, as seen in some other paintings of this period, but they too appear extremely delicate. Amitabha, the spiritual father of Avalokitesvara, occupies the central position at the top of the painting, wearing a red robe covering one shoulder; although of course the robe is undecorated, a single row of white dots borders the contour of his lotus seat within the double row of white petals, closely following the form of his crossed legs. The Bodhisattvas in the top corners have suffered more damage, but the four-armed one at the centre left (Fig. 54) is quite clear, the feet just crossed at the ankles. Of the remaining smaller Bodhisattvas enough can be seen to show that they are in varying postures like those in the Guimet painting, and set on a plain ground originally turquoise in colour (in the Guimet painting this is strewn with flowers, and precious utensils are set before the lowest figures).</p><p>The style, as observed by Waley, is purely Indian. On the central figure the remains can be seen of a triple sacrificial thread dotted in white, behind the arm, and of a purple cloth around the loins; otherwise the figure is unclothed. The fine outlines are characterized by great precision; the petals of the lotus seat are strongly incurved, perhaps even more so than those of the Guimet picture. The same type of lotus pedestal can be seen on another hemp cloth painting in the Stein collection, the mandala of Avalokitesvara (Figs. 74,75), where the main figure is in a similar pose surrounded by a border of vajras, outside which is the parent figure of Amitabha immediately above and small Bodhisattvas alternating with emblems of Avalokitesvara all the way round. Both these paintings of Avalokitesvara are almost entirely Indian in style and must be relatively early in date, certainly no later than the eighth century.</p><p>Although paintings on silk are greatly in the majority among those found in the sealed library by Stein and Pelliot, those on hemp cloth also occur in fair numbers: for instance, in the catalogue of the Pelliot collection 47 pieces are on hemp cloth, 141 on silk and 32 on paper. The Stein collection at the British Museum has only 22 pieces on hemp cloth, but a further 36 are in the Stein collection in New Delhi.</p><p>In some cases, it seems obvious that hemp cloth was a cheaper alternative to silk, but certain paintings, such as the fragmentary square painting shown here, are finely woven and show a high artistic standard, with fine lines and colouring, showing that the material was greatly valued, as indeed is known also from its use for such masterpieces of eighth century Buddhist painting as the Hokkedo kompon mandara, now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，8世紀</p><p>麻布設色</p><p>斷片全圖：高84.0釐米 寬96.0釐米</p><p>圖版部分：高47.6釐米 寬36.5釐米</p><p>斯坦因繪畫55.Ch.xxii.0017</p><p>參照Figs.53、54</p><p>儘管畫面殘損嚴重，顔料的脫落明顯，但看得出此麻繪是一件非常精美的作品（參照Fig.53的全圖）。由於樣式和表現手法與伯希和收集品《不空羂索觀音曼荼羅》（參照伯希和圖錄《敦煌幡和繪畫》篇圖版86圖）極接近，所以其年代應屬吐蕃佔領時期或稍早。其背景的顔色當時也和《不空羂索觀音曼荼羅》相同，是青綠或青色，底描模板的精細，也和後者相同。</p><p>彩色圖版中所刊載的部分是中尊觀音，右手結觸地印而坐。表面的彩色幾乎全部脫落，浮現出極纖細的底描墨線，尤其是臉部非常明顯。當時，觀音身上纏繞的極窄天衣上，曾有過同時代其它作品中也可見的白點裝飾，現在只能見到極其模糊的痕迹。觀音正上方，畫面上段的中央部位，是偏袒右肩著紅衣而坐的阿彌陀如來。那衣物肯定無裝飾，但沿著結跏趺坐的腳線而繪的蓮華座，白色的蓮瓣卻是兩層重疊的，周圍用白點做邊。上段兩旁的菩薩像殘損嚴重，左側中尊位置的四臂像（參照Fig.54）保存良好，可清楚看出雙腿交叉而坐的姿勢。</p><p>除此，圖中可見的幾身小菩薩，與集美收集品的《不空羂索觀音曼荼羅》中的相似，在青綠色的底子上，表現出各自不同的姿勢（集美收集品的繪畫中，背景中撒滿小花，在最下段諸尊的前面擺著金色佛具）。</p><p>如Waley所述的那樣，此畫的形式是純粹印度的風格。除了見到中尊臂後有加白點的三條綬帶，以及腰周圍赤紫色布的痕迹外，那身上另外沒有任何衣物。線描端正優美，蓮華座的蓮瓣，比集美收集品畫中的更向內彎曲。在斯坦因收集品的麻布觀音曼荼羅（參照Figs.74、75）中，也見到同樣形狀的蓮華座。在那幅畫中，中尊坐姿與此畫相同，用并列的金剛杵框围在四周。框的外側，上邊中央配有阿彌陀佛，周圍環繞交錯排列的象徵觀音的標識和小菩薩。那觀音曼荼羅也和此圖一樣，完全是印度風格，兩者都年代較早，可確定不晚於8世紀。</p><p>斯坦因和伯希和從藏經洞帶回的繪畫中，數量最多爲絹繪，麻繪也有一定數量。如在伯希和收集品目錄中所見收錄的繪畫，絹畫有141件，紙繪有32件，麻繪也有47件。斯坦因收集品的麻繪數目爲：大英博物館收藏22件，新德里國立博物館收藏36件。</p><p>在很多场合，麻布被作爲高價絹的代用品使用，但其中也多有像此圖中的繪畫等，紡織精巧，無論如何也想象不到它價值低廉，畫的線描和色彩等美術水準也很高。被稱作8世紀佛教繪畫代表作的波士頓美術館收藏的《法華堂根本曼荼羅》，也是那類作品之一。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 39"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.201</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="san-Latn">Avalokitesvara</title><title lang="chi-Hant">觀世音菩薩像</title><note lang="eng"><p>Late Tang or early Five Dynasties late 9th – early 10th century A.

Most of the larger paintings on hemp cloth, if not narrow banners with a triangular headpiece, were hung in this way, and so must have been the paintings on silk as well. The inscription reads 南無延壽命救苦觀世音菩薩, “The Bodhisattva Guanshiyin who prolongs life and rescues from trouble”. The description matches the compassionate appearance of the Bodhisattva and both are evidence of his widespread popularity in the late Tang and Five Dynasties.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代末期～五代初期,9世紀末～10世紀初</p><p>麻布設色</p><p>全圖（含邊）：高139.0釐米 寬66.0釐米</p><p>圖案部分：高130.0釐米 寬50.0釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫201.Ch.lv.0035</p><p>此圖的幡，各個方面的表現都與上一圖形成對照。上圖的線描纤细優美，而此畫的線描則粗而有力，像周圍的空間也被花和彎曲的天衣填滿。觀音全身裹著衣服，手臂和臉部露出的部分沒有淡淡的肉色，而被圖式化的暈染所代替。從臉部等細部的表現看，可设想为9世紀末期的作品。</p><p>無論是麻布的質地，還是繪畫的表現，明顯比上一圖粗糙。但是，寬幅的布邊部分可見自然的麻布顔色，而中心部位的麻布，在描像之前漂過白。另外，上部還保留着當時的兩個吊環，原來是用棒穿過吊環用以懸挂幡的。與三角形幡頭的窄幅幡不同，大幅的麻繪，大多都用吊環懸挂，絹繪可能也是一樣。</p><p>長方形题笺中寫着“南無延壽命救苦觀世音菩薩”，畫面也著力反映出了菩薩的慈悲。這兩點都可證明觀音在唐末五代時期的廣泛流行。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 40"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.199</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Thousand-armed, Thousand- eyed Avalokitesvara (details)</title><title lang="chi-Hant">千手千眼觀世音菩薩圖（局部）</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, late 8th –early 9th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on hemp cloth</p><p>Whole painting: H. 101. 0cm, W. 102.5 cm</p><p>Dimensions of details shown:(40-1) H. 26.3 cm, W. 24.8 cm，(40-2) H. 33.8 cm, W. 31.9 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting 199.

Two details from the left side are shown here in colour (see Fig. 55 for the whole painting).</p><p>Avalokitesvara, in the centre, is seated instead of standing, so that the whole figure is contained within the great circle of eyes and hands. Around the Bodhisattva are some of the principal figures found in the silk painting. In the upper corners, first of all, are the Bodhisattvas of the Sun and Moon, this time correctly represented on their respective vahanas of horses and geese, with appropriately coloured red and white discs (in Pl. 6 they have been exchanged). Next (Pl. 40-1) is the kneeling Bodhisattva called Scatterer of Flowers in the silk painting. Waley identifies this figure as Sarasvati or Sri Devi, the sister of Vaisravana, but since the figure has none of the attributes of a high-born lady I prefer the simpler interpretation suggested by reference to the painting on silk. The figure on the opposite side, seen in profile with hands raised towards Avalokitesvara, has the emaciated hints of the rishi Vasu, but in combination with a crown of dragon heads exactly as worn by the naga spirits standing in the pool in the lower part of the silk painting (Vol. 1, Pl. 18-5), and indeed in this painting as well. Finally, in the lower corners, on either side of the lotus tank, are flaming vajra deities, with boar-headed attendants, again as in the silk painting, the Fiery-headed Vajra on the left (Pl. 40-2) and the Blue-faced Vajra on the right. Below is a narrow strip of donors, in the costume of the late eighth or early ninth century.</p><p>The omission of numerous other figures has enabled those that remain to be depicted with ample space around them, and with clear detail. The ground on which they are seen is coloured dark blue and finely ruled with triple lines in a lozenge pattern, of which each lozenge contains a floral motif in white (each motif itself composed of small white lozenges). The same background pattern occurs in other works, notably in the woodcut frontispiece to the Diamond Sutra, dated A.D. 868 (Fig. 144). The lotus pedestals for the two middle figures and for Avalokitesvara are elaborately decorated in eighth century fashion, and the painting, apart from a silk border, has a painted floral border as well. Evidently in this case hemp cloth was no mere cheap substitute for silk, but a material valued in its own right.</p><p>See also Figs. 55, 56</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，8世紀末～9世紀初</p><p>麻布設色</p><p>全圖（圖樣部分）：高101.0釐米 寬102.5釐米</p><p>圖版部分：（40－1）高26.3釐米 寬24.8釐米、（40－2）高33.8釐米 寬31.9釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫199.xxi.006</p><p>參照Figs.55、56</p><p>此麻繪的構成，是簡化了的大約同時代的絹繪大作《千手千眼觀世音菩薩圖》，彩色圖版中只刊載了畫面左側中央的天部（參照圖40－1）和其下面的火頭金剛（參照圖40－2）部分，全圖收錄在Fig.55中。</p><p>中尊千手千眼觀音不是立像，而是坐像，全身恰好圈在由無數隻眼和手組成的大圓中。周圍只繪了絹畫中所見的眷屬中的一部分。首先是上段的左右，乘馬的日天和乘鵝的月天，並有各自相應的紅色的日輪和白色的月輪（在圖16的絹繪中，是相反的）。中段，是在絹繪中被標爲“散花”的天部（參照圖40－1），跪著捧花。Waley把她看作是弁財天或功德天，但此像沒有出身高貴的婦人特徵，所以我認爲，和絹繪中的一樣，只是單純地表現天部。在對面，可見跪著向觀音伸出兩手的側臉像，乍一看，其消瘦的姿容很像婆藪仙，但從他頭上戴的五頭龍蓋看，畫的會不會是絹畫下部池中站立的龍王（參照第1卷圖18－8、18－5）？</p><p>在下段，蓮池的兩側各站一身被火焰光圍繞的金剛力士，同時還有豬臉的侍者。和絹畫的情況相同，左邊是火頭金剛（參照圖40－2），右邊是青面金剛。下邊設置了細帶狀的供養人欄，繪著身著8世紀末至9世紀初期的衣裳的供養人。</p><p>由於省略了其他很多像，周圍描繪的六身像每個都很寬鬆，連細部都描得很明確。背景的深青色底子上有三根線組成的斜格子，每個菱形中加了白色的花卉圖案，而每一花卉本身也是由白色的小菱形組成的。回想有咸通九年（868年）紀年的版畫《金剛經》（參照Fig.144）中，也見到过相同的底紋。觀音和中段二尊的蓮華座，有8世紀風格的華麗裝飾，絹縫的邊布內側还可見描有花柄的装裱。从這點看，麻布在此画中，與其說是絹的廉價代用品，不如说認爲有素材方面的價值。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 41"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.154</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="san">Avalokitesvara</title><title lang="chi-Hant">觀世音菩薩像幡</title><note lang="eng"><p>Five Dynasties, early 10th century A.D.</p><p>Ink on hemp cloth</p><p>Total length 194.5 cm</p><p>Painted area: H. 94.0 cm, W. 27.0 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting154.

The figure, the canopy above and the band of lozenges below in summary form are all in ink only. The line has a slightly hesitant quality that could be due to the use of a stiff brush (see Pl. 36). However, I do believe that a brush was used and not some form of pen, as the line moves easily from thick to thin regardless of the direction of the strokes.

The inscription in this and that in the following painting are preserved almost complete. In each case it consists of a description of the figure, the number of the painting and the name of the painter or donor, these three parts being separated by vertical lines. Because the reading is somewhat difficult in parts to make out, the transcription of the Tibetan is given here first, followed by the translation:</p><p>[Sta]-bla-ma-phyogs-kyi-mgon-po-steng-gi-ham-(hum)- tshigs-thams-cad</p><p>Kha-so-brgyad</p><p>The-god-za-leg-mos-bris</p><p>The Holy Lord of the Directions [who is accompanied by] all the Hum mantras of the space above</p><p>Kha-38</p><p>Painted (?) by Leg-mo, the noble lady (?) of The-god</p><p>The figure is here tentatively identified as Akasagarbha, Lord of the Sky, who is sometimes depicted with fierce or frowning countenance (Mochizuki, 1973-74,p. 1136c) and whose cult is closely related to that of Avalokitesvara. The right hand is in vitarka-mudra, which is in accord with the description given by Getty, who also gives the sun as Akasagarbha’s symbol (Getty, 1928,p.101). The sun and the moon are frequently seen in this position in paintings of the Thousand-armed Avalokitesvara. The numeral in the centre must simply refer to the number of the painting in a sequence or series; it is given in two forms, both the abbreviated syllabic system and in ordinary notation. Hugh Richardson, to whom I am indebted, as I am to David Snellgrove and Lama Chime Rimpoche, for assistance with this inscription and the one in Pl. 49, suggests that Leg-mo has a feminine termination (mo). If so, then it would appear that Leg-mo was a noble lady who commissioned the painting, rather than the actual painter.</p><p>The canopy is depicted in the same spare and loose way as the figure, being more of a linear design than a depiction of a three-dimensional cover over the figure. In this it somewhat resembles the shape of the canopies in Pls. 52 and 53,both of which are probably tenth century in date. But the inscriptions in Tibetan, and the concern for the shape of the figure beneath the scarves, suggest an earlier date. It is possible that this and the two other drawings of the series are datable towards the end of the period of Tibetan control. That is around the middle of the ninth century A. D.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，9世紀初～中葉</p><p>紙本設色</p><p>圖案部分：高42.5釐米 寬26.0釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫168*.Ch.00377</p><p>此菩薩像的描繪與上圖的觀世音菩薩像非常相似，只是在皺眉的臉部表情和添加了日月等處有所不同。本圖和下一圖的吐蕃文記錄幾乎完整地保留下來。兩圖中的題記記載像名、圖的序號、畫家或供養人像的名字等三個主要內容，每個內容之間用縱線隔開。文字釋讀存在一定的難度，大致翻譯如下：</p><p>[Sta]-bla-ma-phyogs-kyi-mgon-po-steng-gi-ham-(hum)- tshigs-thams-cad</p><p>Kha-so-brgyad</p><p>The-god-za-leg-mos-bris</p><p>守護各方的尊者……</p><p>38面</p><p>信奉神靈的貴族夫人Leg-mo繪（？）</p><p>此像暫定為虛空藏菩薩。那虛空藏菩薩常常是以憤怒或愁苦的面容出現（參照望月信亨《佛教大辭典》，1973-74，第1136頁），其信仰與觀音信仰有密切關係，手結說法印，表現虛空藏菩薩的象徵有日輪（參照Alice Getty,The Gods of Northen Buddhism.Oxford,1928,p.101）。日輪和月輪在千手千眼觀世音菩薩圖中，也常常有與此相同的配置。</p><p>中央的數字，可能是表示該畫在系列圖中序號；它給了兩種形式，即：縮寫和一般寫法。Hugh Richardson、David Snellgrove、Chime Rimpoche喇嘛對此圖和下圖中吐蕃文記錄的解讀，提供了幫助。Hugh Richardson指出出現在最後的記述中的“Leg-mo”是女性的名字。如果是那樣，她不会是繪畫的畫家，可能是委託製作該繪畫的貴族女性。</p><p>華蓋的描繪與像的幅度大小幾乎相同，完全沒有籠罩著佛像的立體感，看似平面的設計。這與被認爲是10世紀中葉的圖52、53的華蓋形式近似。但是，從吐蕃文字的記錄、注意對條帛下肉體的表現看，可斷定其年代稍早些，結論是，此圖的繪畫和其他兩件一樣是吐蕃佔領期結束的847年以前的作品。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 49"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.169*</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="san">The Arhat Kalika</title><title lang="chi-Hant">迦理迦尊者像</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, early to mid-9th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on paper</p><p>H.43.5 cm, W. 26.0 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting 169*.

The subject is represented as a Chinese traveling monk, seated on a mat, holding a small alms bowl, and with his staff and leather traveling bag beside him. These attributes link him with other monk portraits at Dunhuang, including the drawing shown in Pl. 51. On the other hand, the Tibetan inscription identifies him as one of the Buddha’s traditional early disciples, the arhat Kalika:</p><p>’Phags-pa-nan-thos-chen-po’-dus-ldan-’khor-ston-chig</p><p>[so] go-bzi</p><p>Do-khon-legs-kyis-bris</p><p>The sublime arhat the great Dus-ldan (Kalika) with one hundred thousand disciples</p><p>[so] 94</p><p>Painted by Do-khon-legs</p><p>Kalika has been previously identified, although the number of his disciples was given in Serindia as one thousand one hundred rather than the one hundred thousand of the Tibetan. The syllabic notation of the numeral is missing, but the ends of two of the strokes are still clearly visible; evidently the painting was the ninety-fourth in the same series as Pl. 48. In this case, the last part of the inscription clearly states that Do-khon-legs painted the work. Eiichi Matsumoto (1937, pp. 512-15) suggests that he may have been a Tibetan who had come to Dunhuang. Richardson (personal communication) writes that “Do is the clan name (or family name) of many persons named in documents from Dunhuang, often as copyists of religious works. They were apparently all in a somewhat lowly position, never officials, but whether they were Tibetans proper or local people of one of the many different tribes in the area who took Tibetan names it is not possible to say.”</p><p>The nimbus is of the same type as in the preceding two paintings, narrowly fringed with flame. The face is well drawn, and this together with the rather closely wrapped draperies around the figure suggests a mid-ninth century date.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，9世紀初～中葉</p><p>紙本設色</p><p>高43.5釐米 寬26.0釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫169*.Ch.00376</p><p>曾經講過此畫和前兩圖有著密切關係，有相同的寬幅邊、吐蕃文題記和相同的華蓋。畫像表現為中國雲遊僧，坐在墊子上，右手托著小鐵缽，旁邊立著挂革袋的錫杖。從這些標誌，可以看出與圖51所刊登的敦煌高僧像的關係，而根據吐蕃文的記錄，知道此像是早期的佛弟子之一迦理迦尊者。</p><p>記錄的內容如下：</p><p>’Phags-pa-nan-thos-chen-po’-dus-ldan-’khor-ston-chig</p><p>[so] go-bzi</p><p>Do-khon-legs-kyis-bris</p><p>聖大聲聞迦理迦，弟子10萬人</p><p>94（面）</p><p>Do-khon-legs繪此</p><p>有關迦理迦，就如以前解讀的那樣，而有關其弟子的數量，《西域》中則解讀爲“1100人”而非10萬人。序數詞的部分已經殘損，但是末尾的兩個筆劃清晰可見，和圖48一樣，表示的是系列圖中的第94號。在記錄最後出現的Do-khon-legs是此畫的畫家，在本圖中是很明確的。松本榮一博士認爲，此畫家是來敦煌的吐蕃人（參照《敦煌之研究》1937年，512～515頁）。但是，據Richardson講：“Do”是一個宗族的姓，在很多敦煌文書中都留下這個姓，他們是抄寫經典的寫經生，他們沒有顯赫的地位，是吐蕃人，還是冒用吐蕃人姓的當地其他部族，還很難説。</p><p>頭光被細細的火焰光環繞，和上兩圖的形式相同。面部表情、緊裹身體的衣紋説明是9世紀中葉的作品。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 50"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.178</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Fragment of a Paradise</title><title lang="chi-Hant">淨土圖殘片</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 8th –9th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on paper</p><p>H.57.0 cm, W. 38.0 cm</p><p>Stein painting 178*.

Part of a Bodhi tree and an elaborate canopy show the scale of the composition. Below the canopy can be seen the headdress only of a guardian king, with the head and antlers of a white stag as its distinctive feature. Behind him is a demonic figure, with blue body and red and blue hair, holding aloft a naked child. The same demon and naked child can be seen again behind a guardian king (with peacock headdress) on the right of the Bhaisajyaguru paradise (Vol. 1, Pl.9) and in the woodblock print of Vaisravana (Fig. 153). A gandharva in leopard-skin helm, who appears in the print, is present also in the paradise painting playing a lute, recalling the figure holding a mongoose in Pl. 84 (and Vol. 1, Fig. 111). The naked child betokens Vaisravana’s special association with Khotan: “According to Hsuantsang, the Khotanese ruler claimed to be a descendant of the god. In the beginning, when the land had been a desert, Vaisravana had made his home there. Later, when the kingdom had been founded, a monarch who feared he would go childless prayed in the god’s temple; whereupon the idol’s forehead split open and a baby emerged”. (Soper, 1959, p.240.) In the present fragment on paper too, the demon with the naked child must indicate that the guardian king below is Vaisravana (with another king with a sword at extreme left). In view of the clear orientation towards a centre somewhere to the right of the fragment, we can imagine the scale of the whole paradise.</p><p>From what must have been originally a large painting, a number of smaller fragments also remain. One of them shows a standing Bodhisattva in a purple robe with green lining (Fig. 83). The long smooth locks of hair framing his shoulders suggest an eighth or ninth century date for the fragments. To them, I would venture to suggest, might also be added the beautiful head of a Bodhisattva from the Musee Guimet (Bannieres, No. 185), which is virtually the only other fragment executed in this technique. (Bannieres, No. 2, of two riders in a landscape, another such fragment, is not connected with the paradise painting.)</p><p>The paper shows joins and, according to Akira Fujieda, is typical only of the ninth century at Dunhuang. This conclusion accords well with the style, which would appear to be early ninth century at latest.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，8～9世紀</p><p>紙本設色</p><p>高57.0釐米 寬38.0釐米</p><p>斯坦因繪畫178*.Ch.00373.a</p><p>參照Fig.83</p><p>這個殘片是在相當厚的紙上用不透明的顔料繪的，可能是大型淨土圖的殘片，從菩提樹和精巧華蓋的一部分可以推測出它原來的規模。華蓋下邊，只剩下白色雄鹿的頭和叉角，和天王像頭飾的一部分。其背後是青色身體、紅綠混合色頭髮的魔鬼，托著裸身幼兒。在《藥師淨土變相圖》（第1卷圖9）右部的頭戴孔雀冠的天王像背後，以及木板畫《毘沙門天像》（Fig.153）右部，也能見到相同的魔鬼和裸身幼兒。在那個木版畫的淨土圖中，彈琵琶的乾達婆，是頭戴豹皮，手提貓鼬站立的，其形象與圖84（與第1卷Fig.111是同一作品）中的跟隨毘沙門天的乾達婆形象類似。裸身的幼兒預示著毘沙門天與于闐之間的特別關係：“根據玄奘所述，于闐國王請求毘沙門天降臨。當初，國土整個是個沙漠時，毘沙門天也在那裏建立家園。其後，當建立王國後，國王憂慮沒有孩子，就在毘沙門天寺做祈禱時，偶像的額裂開了，現出一個嬰兒”（參照Alexander Coburn Soper;Literary Evidence for Early Buddhist Art in China.Ascona,1959. p.240）。因而，此斷片中也是魔鬼和裸身的幼兒，顯示在其下方畫的天王像是毘沙門天（其左側有一持劍的天王）。</p><p>此斷片的右方，明顯連接著中心部分的一處，由此可以推斷出淨土的全部規模。當時，這應該是一件很大的作品，除了本圖中所刊登的部分外，還有很多小斷片。其中有一件是身著表面爲赤紫色、裏子爲綠色袈裟的菩薩立像圖（參照Fig.83）。那菩薩像的頭髮呈很大的結狀披在兩肩上，從而可推斷那些斷片是8～9世紀的作品。我斗膽推測集美美術館收藏的描繪精美的菩薩頭部的斷片（參照伯希和圖錄《敦煌幡畫》，圖185）也是此畫的一部分。相同技法的斷片，在大英博物館以外收藏的作品，至今只有此一件（《敦煌幡畫》圖2風景畫中的兩個騎士的斷片則與本淨土圖毫無關係）。</p><p>據藤枝晃教授的判斷，該斷片的紙張是典型的9世紀敦煌地區的紙張，這正與這種畫風的時代相吻合，因此最晚也不過是9世紀初。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 51"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.163</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Portrait of a monk</title><title lang="chi-Hant">高僧像</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, late 9th –early 10th century A.D.</p><p>Ink on paper</p><p>H.46.0 cm, W. 30.0 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting163. Ch. 00145</p><p>This fine drawing of a monk has a rather special place among the paintings of the Stein collection. In Pl. 49 we have already seen how the arhat Kalika was represented as a Chinese monk seated on his mat, his staff planted in the ground beside him and his leather wallet hanging from it. The staff and the wallet, which in the present painting is hung on a tree instead, were standard items of equipment for a traveling monk, together with others such as the water vase, rosary and shoes shown here. Several of these items also appear in the wall paintings of the small cave that has come to be known as the sealed library, where all the manuscripts and paintings were obtained by Stein, Pelliot and others. In fact this small cave was a memorial chapel for Hongbian, the chief of the monks in Hexi. He died circa A.D. 862, and the memorial chapel must have been hollowed out around that time. Most recently, a portrait statue of Hongbian has been identified and returned to the cave; it had been removed to an upper storey, probably in the eleventh century when the manuscripts and paintings were all stored away and sealed (see Wenwu, 1978/12).</p><p>Although there is no suggestion that the present drawing could represent the same monk (in fact it probably dates some fifty years or more after Hongbian’s death), it seems very appropriate that this form of monk portrait should have been preserved in such a memorial chapel. The statue in Cave 17 is seated in meditation posture on a low platform, on one end of which are painted his shoes, with cloud toes like those seen here and like those of which actual examples have been preserved in the Stein collection (see Vol. 3). The wall paintings behind the statue in Cave 17 provide a grander setting, with large trees and two attendant figures, but the leather wallet and water-bottle hanging from the trees are just as prominently portrayed. One of Pelliot’s photographs (Grottes,Pl. XCⅦ) shows another niche with a statue of a monk, while the setting for another is in Cave 443, once more with trees and a whole array of equipment: water-bottle, staff, and several bags and wallets (see Wenwu, 1978/12).</p><p>The drawing is an excellent example of ink outline drawing at Dunhuang of which numerous other examples have been published by Jao Tsong-yi (1978). One is also reminded of the fine portrayal of a monk holding an incense burner at the end of the scrolls of Buddhist iconography of the Kongokai Mandara (Tang dynasty, eighth century, owned by Onjo-ji, Shiga prefecture). Eminent monks such as Hongbian, who was accorded the privilege of wearing purple by the emperor after Dunhuang returned to Chinese rule in A.D. 847, were important figures at Dunhuang, closely associated with the ruling families and with the dedication of new or reconstructed caves. The ink lines are confidently drawn, well modulated to show the features of the face and the fall of draperies over the figure. A date in the late ninth or very early tenth century is suggested on account of the hooked mouthline and the way in which the eye begins to break the outline of the face.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，9世紀末～10世紀初</p><p>紙本墨畫</p><p>高46.0釐米 寬30.0釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫163.Ch.00145</p><p>此畫是用優美的墨線繪的高僧像，在斯坦因收集的绘画中，是一件很特殊的作品。在圖49中，曾看過以中國僧侶形象描繪的迦理迦尊者坐在墊子上，旁邊立著錫杖，其上挂著革袋。在此畫中，雖然革袋是挂在樹上，但無論怎樣，像錫杖、革袋，再加上此畫中出現的水瓶、念珠、靴子等，都是雲遊僧标准的必備品。在斯坦因与伯希和所獲的经卷、绘画的藏經洞壁畫中，也可見到那些物品中的若干件。本來那小窟是河西僧統洪辯的影窟，洪辯去世的年代爲862年左右，此小窟也是那時期開鑿的。近年，洪辯的塑像被確認，移入洞內。大概是11世紀把經典和繪畫等封进洞窟時，移到上方洞窟的（參照《文物》1978年第12期）。</p><p>雖然此畫本身不是描繪的洪辯（恐怕此繪畫的製作是在洪辯死後50年，或者過了更長時間），但此種形式的高僧像收入僧人的影窟非常適宜。第17窟（藏經洞）中的洪辯像，是冥思沉想的坐像，安置於低臺上，台的一側繪著也在此畫中見到的雲頭履。在斯坦因的搜集品中有這種靴子的實物（見第3卷）。第17窟塑像背後描繪的壁畫場面宏大，繪有兩棵很大的樹和兩個侍者。特別是挂在樹上的革袋和水瓶的寫實的描繪，很引人注目。伯希和拍攝的一張照片（參照《石窟圖錄》圖版97）中，見到有安置高僧像的別的窟的佛龕，另外，在第443窟的壁畫中，也描繪有樹，水瓶、錫杖、革袋、雲頭履等所有的裝備也都繪了進去（參照《文物》1978年第12期）。</p><p>饒宗頤教授的《敦煌白畫》中介紹了很多墨畫的範例，本圖的繪畫是那些敦煌墨畫中特别优秀的作品之一，與《五部心觀》（唐代8世紀的作品，現藏于滋賀縣的圓城寺）卷末见到的持香爐僧侶们的精美肖像相仿。唐朝收复敦煌後（847年）以後，敦煌的高僧，像洪辯一樣受了唐朝皇帝的賜紫，在敦煌是舉足輕重的重要人物，與地方豪族有密切聯繫，與石窟的新建和修復有密切的關係。</p><p>此畫中的墨線充滿自信，表情以及裹着身体的衣紋線描都非常美。從嘴角的鈎狀表现，和断開臉部輪廓線顯示的眼睛等手法判斷，此作品的製作年代在9世紀末至10世紀初之間。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 52"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.15</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Avalokitesvara (Water-moon Guanyin)</title><title lang="chi-Hant">水月觀音圖</title><note lang="eng"><p>Five Dynasties, mid-10th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on paper</p><p>H.82.9 cm, W. 29.6 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting15.

Ch.0054</p><p>The story of the visit of the Bodhisattva Manjusri to Vimalakirti on his sick-bed was immensely popular in China. Vimalakirti was a rich Indian layman, skilled at argument and with a profound knowledge of the Buddha’s teachings. When the Buddha asked his disciples to go and enquire after Vimalakirti’s health, they refused one after another, recalling previous occasions when he had outwitted them. Finally Manjusri, the Bodhisattva of Wisdom agreed to go, and a great concourse assembled to hear their discussion, which covered subjects such as the nature of non-duality, and the illness of a Bodhisattva. The debate ends with Manjusri expressing his unqualified admiration for the depth of Vimalakirti’s knowledge. The Vimalakirti-sutra is one of the most important in Mahayana Buddhism; Chinese scholars, introduced to it through the excellent translation made by Kumarajiva (died A.D. 413), appreciated Vimalskirti’s intellectual qualities, and no doubt his wit also; when the disciple Sariputra entered the assembly and found no seat, Vimalakirti read his thoughts, and asked if he had come to hear the Law, or to look for seats. In this painting only Manjusri is seen; Vimalakirti would have been shown on his bed, holding a fan, in a matching composition on the left. A ruler in a splendid robe with dragons and the sun and moon motifs, one of those who had come to hear the discussion, is seen in the foreground (Pl. 53-4). Instead of Manjusri’s usual mount, the lion, a number of small lions are shown in the openings beneath the dais on which he is seated (Pl. 53-3).</p><p>The subject has already been seen in a silk painting of the late eighth century (Vol. 1, Pl. 20), which, though much damaged, still shows the subject in considerable detail, with a number of the miracles wrought by Vimalakirti appearing above the scene of the actual debate.</p><p>A measure of simplification is seen in a series of ink sketches of the subject on separate sheets of paper, afterwards pasted together (Figs. 86-88). The scenes shown include the city of Vaisali; Manjusri and part of the assembly (Fig. 86b); and, on the reverse side (Fig. 86a), Vimalakirti on his covered sick-bed, with monks and Bodhisattvas (one group seated on a cloud, one pouring rice from a bowl, see below). These scenes and the text of a letter (translated by Waley, 1931, pp.315-16) are on two of the sheets. The third sheet has only a few figures on one side, and several of the meditations of Queen Vaidehi on the other; it is pasted upside-down in relation to the first two sheets. Like another series of ink sketches on paper, of scenes from a paradise of Maitreya (Fig. 85, British Library, S. 259), these may have been copied from a wall painting.</p><p>Although on paper, this painting has the character of a finished work. The iconography is still further simplified and even altered to suit not only the smaller format but the requirements of a later time. Through this process Manjusri has become the dominant figure, almost as if the painting were devoted to him alone, with a retinue of much smaller figures of Bodhisattvas, monks, guardian kings and a Dharmapala behind him. In the foreground, the king or ruler, with an even more numerous group of attendants, is also very prominent; this is in keeping with the more sumptuous portrayal of donor figures in the Five Dynasties and early Song dynasty. Nothing is left of the setting to the debate, and of the other narrative scenes seen in the silk painting there are only two. The first shows a Bodhisattva pouring rice out of a bowl, to demonstrate, as Waley put it, its inexhaustibility: “one of the auditors thought ‘This rice is little and all the persons of the great assembly must eat’. The Dhyani Bodhisattva replied: ‘Sooner shall the four seas be empty than this rice fail’.” The second scene is smaller still, just under the canopy, and shows three small boys playing musical instruments (Pl. 53-2). Possibly this charming group is an adaptation of the episode when the sons of elders of the city of Vaisali offered precious canopies to Sakyamuni.</p><p>In style and composition, this painting is closely related to the painting of Avalokitesvara (Pl.52), with an almost identical canopy and figures supported in similar fashion on small clouds. There is also a similarity in size between the main figures of Avalokitesvara and Manjusri, and in the prominence of the single donor figure in Pl.52, who like the ruler in this painting is shown within the main picture area rather than outside it. Although the costume and headdress of Manjusri still follow ninth century prototypes, the manner of their depiction, such as the flattening of drapery folds or the summary execution of facial features, indicates that this painting dates from the tenth century.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>五代時期，10世紀中葉</p><p>紙本設色</p><p>高73.2釐米 寬30.7釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫31*.Ch.0054</p><p>文殊菩薩訪問病床上的維摩居士的故事，在中國廣爲人知。維摩是印度富裕的居士，有辯才，對佛教有很深的造詣。佛陀委託弟子們去探望病中的維摩時，弟子們想起曾被維摩的辯論擊敗，紛紛辭退。結果，作爲智慧菩薩的文殊同意去探望，聚集了衆多聽他們答辯的人群。答辯涉及到了不二法門以及菩薩的疾病，故事以文殊從心底讚歎維摩的淵博知識而結束。《維摩經》是大乘佛教最重要的經典之一。中國的佛教學者們是通過鳩摩羅什（死於413年）的優秀的漢譯本，充分瞭解到有關維摩的聰明資質和機智的。如，佛弟子舍利弗到了集結地，看已經滿座，怎麽也找不到空座，維摩看出他的意思，就問是來聽法呢？還是爲了來找座？</p><p>本圖僅見文殊菩薩，可能與其相對的左幅位置，描繪著維摩手持扇子，橫臥床上的姿容。此圖的前景中有前來聽講的國王，國王身著龍和日月文樣的華麗禮服（參照圖53－4）。文殊通常是乘獅子，但在這裏卻坐在方形台座上，台座上繪著很多小獅子作爲替代（參照圖53－3）。</p><p>此主題的繪畫曾在8世紀末的絹畫（參照第1卷圖20）中見過，那絹畫雖然殘損嚴重，但對細部的描繪都很詳細，答辯場面上方繪有因維摩的辯論出現的幾處奇迹。另外，還有簡單墨描的《維摩經變相圖》（參照Fig.86～88）。它現在的形式是後來用幾張草圖粘合成的。正面（參照Fig.86－b）有毘耶離城的場景和文殊菩薩及聽衆的一部分；背面（參照Fig.86－a）是圍著病榻上的維摩的菩薩和比丘等（繪有乘雲的一群菩薩，手持缽中的香飯要溢出的樣子，見下）。這些場景和書寫的經文（參照Waley《敦煌畫目錄》，315～316頁）佔據了兩紙，另一紙的正面有數人，背面描著韋提希夫人十六想觀的數個場景。第三紙粘在前兩紙上。同樣的墨描作品，還有《彌勒下生經變白描粉本》（參照Fig.85），這些可能都是壁畫的模寫。</p><p>本圖的作品雖然是繪在紙上，但是完整的畫作。圖像方面，不僅合乎小型畫面，也應了時代的需要，有很大的簡化和變更。整個畫面似乎只供奉文殊菩薩一人，把他畫得很大。菩薩、比丘、天王，以及其背後的護法神等文殊的眷屬被畫得很小。前景中的國王也比衆多隨從繪得稍大，很突出。從五代一直到北宋時期的供養畫中，都可見到相關的配有華麗衣裳的肖像式的供養人。畫面中未見一個表現辯論的場景，絹畫中所見的故事場景也只見到兩處，一是從菩薩所持的缽中有香飯溢出的樣子，Waley指出這是描寫無盡藏，化菩薩回答說：如果想食盡這香飯比喝盡四海還困難”。另一處是在華蓋的正下方，有在雲端上奏樂的三個童子（參照圖53－2）。這可愛的群體，是毘耶離城的長者子向釋迦牟尼奉獻昂貴的華蓋故事的翻版。</p><p>風格和圖像方面，可看出此圖與前面的《水月觀音圖》（圖52）有非常密切關係，華蓋形狀、乘著小雲的圖像風格也大致相同。另外，此文殊菩薩的尺寸與上圖的觀音大致相同。上一圖中只有一個供養人，並且佔據著圖的主要位置，這和本圖前景的國王一樣，是爲了突出他的重要性。文殊菩薩的衣裳以及髮型沿襲了9世紀的原型，但描繪中也見到像衣褶的表現非常單調呆板，容貌也有簡筆畫的風格等10世紀作品的特徵。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 54"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.157</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Avalokitesvara</title><title lang="chi-Hant">觀世音菩薩像</title><note lang="eng"><p>Late Tang or Five Dynasties, late 9th- early 10th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on paper</p><p>H.46.0 cm, W. 30.4 cm</p><p>Stein painting 157*.

Ch. 00147</p><p>This drawing is one of the most impressive of the animals found at Dunhuang. Its immediate impact as it strikes the eye is due to its powerful compositional structure, and it leaves the viewer in no doubt as to the stature of the artist. At the same time, the rhythm of the ink lines does not seem to suggest the use of the brush, since all the lines are short and nowhere do they show the parting of the brush hairs. In the case of longer spirals, for example those forming the manes, these seem to be made up of two or more arcs or semicircles. Most of the strokes also end in a point, and there are fairly abrupt transitions from thick to thin and vice-versa. Similar strokes in a sketch of a horse from the Pelliot collection have been described as jianbi 簡筆 (abbreviated brushstrokes) by Jao Tsong-yi (1978, Pelliot chinois 2951, Pl. LⅡ), and they have also been discussed in the context of the banner paintings (Vol. 1, Pls. 56-58), where such short discontinuous strokes appear side with long, smooth, continuous strokes clearly done with the brush, and with colour washes also added with the brush. It would therefore seem that the short strokes were done with a stiffer instrument. This might have been a wooden or reed pen, although those examples so far actually discovered seem more adapted for the writing of certain non-Chinese scripts with distinctive regular features than for this kind of free pictorial representation. The banner paintings are clear evidence that the hair brush was used at the same time, to the use of a stiffer instrument for a drawing such as the lion must have been deliberate in order to obtain certain vivid effects.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，9世紀末</p><p>紙本墨畫</p><p>高29.8釐米 寬42.8釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫169.Ch.00147</p><p>此繪畫也是敦煌發現動物畫中給人印象最深刻的作品之一。首先奪目的是強有力的構圖風格，從這一點誰都不能不承認畫家技術的高超。同時，線描是有節奏的粗短線，看不到筆尖分開的痕迹，會不會是用毛筆繪的，這一點也應引起注意。例如，頭上鬃的長卷毛，線條都是由二根或者更多的半圓形弧線組成，其他的線條也有在中途連接時，粗線突然變成細線，有時則相反。同樣的筆法還見于伯希和收集品中繪馬的畫（參照P.2951《敦煌白畫》圖52），饒宗頤教授把它稱爲“簡筆”。有關此筆法，曾在幡畫項（參照第1卷圖56～58解說）中也接觸到了，那些作品中斷斷續續的短線，與分明是只有用毛筆才能畫出的流暢的長線拼在一起用，短的線描顯然是使用了某種硬筆畫的，還加了用毛筆表現的暈染。硬筆可能是用木和蘆制的，而至今發掘的遺物是，與其說在繪畫中使用，還不如考慮爲，只是用於寫漢字以外的非常整齊的文字時所用的工具。但在幡畫中，確實是與毛筆合用，像本獅子圖一樣的白描畫中，也爲獲得逼真的效果而使用。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 56"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.77</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Tribute horse and camel</title><title lang="chi-Hant">馬·駱駝圖</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, late 9th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on paper</p><p>H.30.5 cm, W.84.5 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting77. Ch. 00207</p><p>These two animals are depicted in lively fashion, each attended by a groom or keeper. Although the whip of a third driver is visible on the right, this is not a caravan of merchants or a series of haphazard sketches; despite its swift execution, it is a record of animals brought as tribute, of the kind that is known through the lost masterpiece of Li Gonglin 李公麟, Five Tribute Horses, which itself followed a genre already well established in the Tang. The grooms in the Stein sketch stand close to their charges, as if drawn up for inspection. A rather different impression is given in a manuscript in the British Library illustrating the Perils from which Avalokitesvara offered protection, as an armed warrior confronts a man leading a camel and mule, with the Bodhisattva intervening (Fig. 95-2). There. Despite the resemblance of the animals to those shown here, the context clearly indicates a merchant and his caravan.</p><p>Each of the animals occupies a whole sheet of paper, the sheets being stuck together, with the leading edge of the third sheet overlapping a centimetre or so on the right. On the back of the drawing is an inscription dated in the fourth year of Qiande of the Song (A.D.966) and relating to the repair of temples by the ruler of Dunhuang, Cao Yuanzhong (Fig.84). This date and a few other phrases from the inscription were practiced first on the painted side of the paper. According to Waley, these phrases were written before the sketches were made; but a close inspection of the work shows that the pale ink characters lie over the colour washes that lend a certain finish to the two animals. Furthermore, the long inscription on the back extends only about three-quarters of the length of the two surviving sheets of paper, not reaching the third sheet. I am therefore in no doubt that the inscription, which contains numerous crossed-out characters, was itself merely a rough draft, and that the sketches must date considerably earlier, and not later, than A.D. 966.</p><p>There is in Berlin, in the Museum für Indische Kunst, a handsome drawing of a horse (Acc. No.Ⅲ 7587) not unlike these sketches but without a groom, and more careful in execution. There too there is writing on the back, but apparently directly related to the subject, since it seems to number horses and the amounts of food eaten by them. The piece was found at Khotan. Among the Pelliot manuscripts in the Bibliothèque Nationale, P. 3951 shows a horse and P. 4717 a camel, depicted in ink outline only, and without grooms, but otherwise similar to the Stein fragment (Jao Tsong-yi, 1978, Pls.

Ch. i. 0023</p><p>Ucchusma, known in China as “the Unclean” because he subdues all unclean influences, appears in several of the paintings from Dunhuang, but always as part of a larger assembly centring on the Thousand-armed, Thousand-eyed Avalokitesvara (see Fig. 55 and Vol. 1, Pl. 18). In this last painting he is identified as the Fiery-headed Vajra, and stands opposite the Blue-faced Vajra.</p><p>For this painting too, as already noted by Eiichi Matsumoto (1937,pp. 726-27), there is a matching counterpart to Ucchusma, another sketch on the same paper and of approximately the same dimensions, namely the figure identified as Hayagriva, the horse-headed form of Avalokitesvara (Bannières, No. 89). The resemblances are not only in the general attitude and colouring, but in much of the detail as well: the two figures wear the same thick twisted “sacrificial thread” dotted in white, and similar birds’ heads and monster masks appear among the flames that surround them. Matsumoto was in no doubt that the two pieces were by the same artists; one might go further and suggest that they are sketches for two sides of the same composition, perhaps for a wall painting. Such sketches must have been limited in size by the size of the paper available locally, usually in sheets of about 30 cm by 45 cm. Two sheets could be joined by pasting, but larger areas were more difficult. In any case, it is obvious from the lack of back-ground that the figure here is studied as a unit on its own, to be combined with others in the final composition. Thus, this kind of drawing appears rather different in intent from a copy of an existing painting, such as the drawing in the Pelliot collection referred to in the entry on Pl. 16. It should however be noted that, when found, the Stein painting was furnished with a wooden stick at the bottom and a bamboo stretcher at the top, so that it must have been hung at some time as a complete painting in itself, whatever the original intention.</p><p>From a stylistic point of view, the depiction using short disconnected ink strokes of varying thickness to outline the torso, limbs and face strongly recalls the banners on silk of the late ninth century, such as in Vol. 1, Pl. 58. It does not appear to have become simplified to the extent seen in the Thousand-armed Avalokitesvara in the Pelliot collection, dated A.D. 943 (Bannières, No. 101). A date towards the end of the ninth or the very beginning of the tenth century is therefore proposed for this painting.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，9世紀末</p><p>紙本設色</p><p>高80.7釐米 寬30.8釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫40.Ch.i.0023</p><p>烏樞沙摩明王由於可燒盡世間汙物，在中國被視爲是不淨憤怒，在敦煌的繪畫中也可見到幾例，多出現在圍繞著千手千眼觀音的群像中（參見Fig.55及第1卷圖18）。表現在千手千眼觀世音菩薩圖中時，是以火頭金剛的形象，放在與青面金剛相對的位置上。</p><p>正如松本榮一博士曾經指出的（參見《敦煌畫の研究》，1937年，726-727頁），有一幅與此烏樞沙摩明王像成對的畫，同樣的紙質上描繪著尺寸大致相同的馬頭觀音（參見伯希和《敦煌幡畫》，圖89）。兩者不僅在像容和色彩上，而且在細節的刻畫上也都有相似之處。如兩像都有粗而扭擰的帶白點的瓔珞，在包圍全身的火焰間畫有鳥頭和獸面。松本博士確信這兩幅畫出自同一作者之手，再按其觀點進一步推測，兩者大概是壁畫兩側的畫的底樣。底樣通常使用30釐米×45釐米左右的當地出產的紙，受其尺寸的制約，即使將兩張紙豎著並排粘接起來，也無法得到更大的幅面。總之，此畫顯然沒有背景部分，因此最終還是要和其他部分組合在一起研究。</p><p>如上所述，此畫與圖16解說中提到的伯希和藏品中的白描畫一樣，不是對已有繪畫的臨摹，而是新作品的底樣。然而，本圖中的畫在被發現時，下部裝有木棒，上部有竹芯，因此不管最初的意圖如何，其本身曾被懸挂過一個時期。</p><p>從圖樣的角度觀察，此畫的身體、手腳、臉部等均使用有粗有細的短墨線勾畫的表現方式，讓人想起9世紀末的幡畫，如第1卷圖58。這種表現手法，在伯希和收集的943年的千手千眼觀世音菩薩圖（參見伯希和圖錄《敦煌幡畫》，圖101）中已趨簡化。因此，可以推測此畫繪於9世紀末或10世紀的最初。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 58"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.166</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Prajapati (Brahma as Lord of Living Creatures)</title><title lang="chi-Hant">那羅延天（造物主）</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, late 9th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on paper</p><p>H.46.0 cm, W.31.3 cm</p><p>Stein painting166. Ch. 00162</p><p>This painting and that of Yama-deva (Fig. 109) belong to the same series, both being rather crudely drawn and simply coloured with brick-red, pale bluish grey and pale greenish brown.</p><p>While I have followed Arthur Waley’s identifications of these two pictures, precise identification may need to await further study of the special features of Dunhuang iconography by competent experts. Waley drew attention to the fact that this figure and the bird on which he is mounted resemble the Golden-winged Bird King seen to the right of the large Thousand-armed, Thousand-eyed Avalokitesvara (Vol. 1, Pl. 18-8). For the present I should merely like to note that nearly all of the iconographical elements, both in this painting and in Fig. 109, appear to have been taken from that painting or another Thou-sand-armed, Thousand-eyed Avalokitesvara. The figure mounted on the bird holds the skull-stick, which is an attribute held in one of Avalokitesvara’s forty principal hands. Against his breast he holds a child grasping a ball or globe. The same child holding a red ball is found in a similar position with Mahesvara (Vol. 1, Pl. 18-10).</p><p>In both cases the reference is to the role of the figure holding the child (whether Brahma or Mahesvara [Siva]) as creator of all living things. Further elements taken from the same source can be seen in Fig. 109, where Yama-deva (still adopting Waley’s identification) is a six-armed figure of fierce aspect, holding the sun and moon, a vase and a rope, and standing on a bull. The bull strongly resembles Mahesvara’s vehicle (Vol. 1, Pl. 18-10), with the head in the same attitude-even though the body of the bull is turned the other way –and the forefoot extended in the same fashion. The six-armed figure recalls, though not so closely, the depiction of Mahakala (Vol. 1, Pl. 18-2), and the four objects that he holds all among the attributes held by the forty principal arms of Avalokitesvara.</p><p>Whether considered from the roughness of the style or the apparently hybrid iconography, this painting and Fig. 109 are of a somewhat different nature from Pl. 57, despite being related to the same subject. While Pl. 57 might have been a preparatory sketch for a new painting, these appear to be more experimental in character, combining various elements perhaps had special meaning for the painter or his patron. The date would seem to be late ninth or possibly early tenth century.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代末期～五代初期，9世紀末～10世紀初</p><p>紙本設色</p><p>高46.0釐米  寬31.3釐米</p><p>斯坦因繪畫 166.Ch.00162</p><p>本圖與Fig 109焰摩天圖屬於同一系列，都用簡單的墨線描繪，加了磚紅色、淡青灰色、淡綠褐色等簡單的色彩。</p><p>這兩幅作品的定名，我目前仍然沿用Arthur Waley的判斷，精確的定名尚需有能力的專家依據敦煌圖像學作進一步的研究。Waley注意到此圖中所乘坐的鳥，與大幅千手千眼觀世音菩薩圖（第1卷圖18）右下部所見的金翅鳥王有類似的地方。而我目前只能指出這幅畫以及Fig. 109的圖像因素不只採自這幅千手千眼觀世音菩薩圖，而且還採自其他千手千眼觀世音菩薩圖。</p><p>本圖中的像乘坐在鳥背上，手持千手觀音的主要四十隻手持物品之一的帶髑髏的手杖，胸前抱著持珠童子。千手千眼觀世音圖中同樣位置也有胸前抱童子的摩醘首羅天（參見第1卷圖18-10），那童子也持紅珠。雙方（本圖是那羅延天即毗瑟紐神，其他是摩醘首羅天即濕婆神）均懷抱童子，這標示着萬物創造者的角色。Fig. 109中的像，也同樣可見從此千手千眼觀世音菩薩圖中汲取的素材。那焰摩天（目前採用Waley的定名）是充滿力感的六臂像，手持日月和水瓶、絹索，站在雄牛上。首先，那頭雄牛與摩醘首羅天乘坐的牛（參見第1卷圖18-10），頭的姿勢相同，而這頭牛身體則轉向它方，兩隻牛一隻前蹄均伸向前方，姿勢相同。六臂的像，雖然並非非常接近，但可使我們想起摩訶迦羅天（參見第1卷圖18-2），焰摩天所持四件物品都在千手千眼觀世音菩薩四十隻手所持的物品中。</p><p>以上所述，可以認爲本圖和Fig.109在風格粗略、圖像混合這一點上，與圖57的特性略有不同，儘管其表現的題材是一樣的。圖57是為新畫作準備的畫樣，既含有很多實驗性的因素，也凝結了畫家或捐助者特殊的各種需要。其年代可能在9世紀末或10世紀初。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 59"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.168</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Travelling monk</title><title lang="chi-Hant">行腳僧圖</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, late 9th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on paper</p><p>H.41.0 cm, W.29.8 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting 168. Ch. 00380</p><p>Several examples of this figure of a traveling monk with a fly-whisk and a back-carrier of Buddhist scrolls, accompanied by a tiger and protected by a small figure of the Buddha, are known from Dunhuang and have been studied first by Eiichi Matsumoto, then by Terukaze Akiyama (Bijutsu Kenkyu, no. 238, Jan. 1966) and more recently by Paul Demiéville (Jao Tsong-yi, 1978, pp. 43-49). Two of them are in the Stein collection at the British Museum: the one shown in this plate and a smaller fragment (Fig. 105).</p><p>All these drawings on paper show the monk and the tiger supported on clouds, here largely corroded away by the pigment used to depict them, as is the cloud supporting the small Buddha above. Two paintings on silk in the Pelliot collection (Bannières, Nos. 206, 207), also studied by Akiyama, show the monk and the tiger actually walking through a landscape. Both are drawn with fine lines and considerable care. Akiyama has dated them to the ninth century and to the end of the ninth century respectively, the latter date on account of part of a letter dating from the mid-ninth century which was lining the back of the painting. In my view, however, details such as the bird perching on a rock in one painting and the facial details of the monk in the other (close to those of the monks in Vol. 1, Pl. 7-2) indicate that both paintings are of eighth century date (the ninth century letter must simply have been added later as a repair to the back of the painting). It is the second, damaged at the top but with colours still very intense and bright, that is of the greater interest, since the mysterious figure of the monk is there labeled as Baosheng rulai 寶勝如來. Two of the paintings on paper from the Otani collection (one in Seoul National Museum, one in a private collection in Japan) are also so labelled. Akiyama has noted that while Baosheng is known from two books of ritual translated by Amoghavajra to correspond to the Sanskrit Prabhutaratna, a famous statue of Baosheng in the Canmo 讃摩 temple at Khotan is recorded in the biography of Seng Biao 僧表, in the Biographies of Eminent Monks 名僧伝 written by Bao Chang 寶昌 in A.D.514, and he therefore concludes that Baosheng must have been revered as a deity who protected travellers who crossed deserts. Akiyama therefore felt that it was Baosheng himself who was represented as a monk carrying sacred writings. While accepting that there is a well-attested link in the three paintings with Prabhutaratna, I agree with Demieville in identifying Prabhutaratna as the small Buddha on a cloud who is shown in almost every case (the exception is the Musée Guimet painting with the clearest of the labels, but even there the top of the painting is apparently incomplete and might originally have contained a representation of the Buddha). Whatever the original identity of the main figure, the monk with his load of scrolls was a powerful image that lived on in later images identified either as the famous monk Xuanzang who traveled to India between A.D. 629 and A.D. 645, or as the lohan Dharmatrata, who, accompanied by a tiger, was an addition to the original total of sixteen lohans in China and Tibet. The numerous confusions and variations of this last name are discussed in detail by Paul Demiéville (Jao Tsongyi, 1978, pp. 43-49).</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，9世紀末</p><p>紙本設色</p><p>高41.0釐米 寬29.8釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫 168.Ch.00380</p><p>身背裝經卷的書箱，手持麈尾，跟著老虎，由小的佛像護佑着的行腳僧圖，在敦煌畫中可見到幾件。對此，首先是松本榮一博士，其次是秋山光和教授（參見《美術研究》238號，1965年1月）、再是戴密微教授（參見饒宗頤《敦煌白畫》，1978年，43-49頁）發表過各種研究。大英博物館藏斯坦因搜集品中可見兩件，一件是本圖所示，另一件是稍小一點的殘片（參見圖105）。</p><p>這些紙繪作品都有一個共同的特點，即行腳僧和老虎都乘雲。在本圖中，那雲與上方的小佛駕的雲一樣，但由於顔料的腐蝕作用，大多脫落。秋山光和也研究了伯希和收集品中的兩件絹畫（參見伯希和圖錄《敦煌的幡和繪畫》，圖206、207），僧與虎都是在地上行走，沒有駕雲。兩件都用細線描繪，相當細緻。秋山教授認爲，其年代一件在9世紀，另一件爲9世紀末。之所以認爲後者製作於9世紀末，是因爲畫的襯紙上書寫的文字是9世紀中期的。然而我認爲從其中一幅圖岩石上站著的鳥，和另一幅圖行腳僧面部的表現手法（與第1卷圖7－2中所見比丘的表情近似）等方面看，我想兩者是不是8世紀的？（我認爲寫有9世紀文字的紙，是後來爲修補背面畫而粘上去的襯紙）。此外，雖然那後圖的上端有些殘缺，但留下的色彩至今還很鮮豔。尤其引人注目的是，這位謎一樣的僧人起著“寶勝如來”的名字。</p><p>大谷收集品中也有兩件題有“寶勝如來”的紙繪作品（一件藏在韓國中央博物館，另一件爲日本私人所藏）。秋山教授舉出不空譯的兩種儀軌中，“寶勝”一詞被用於翻譯梵語中的“多寶如來”，及寶唱514年所撰的《名僧傳》的僧表傳中，也有關於于闐國讚摩伽藍的著名寶勝像的記載，由此推斷寶勝如來是沙漠旅行者們的守護神。因此秋山教授認爲，這個背負經卷的行腳就是寶勝如來。而我承認有“寶勝如來”記錄的三件作品，與多寶如來有密切的聯繫。我也認同戴密微教授的觀點，认为除一件外，其餘图中的駕雲小佛就是寶勝如來（這個例外是指前面提到過的伯希和收藏品的絹畫，長方形题笺中记有寶勝如來的作品。但此畫的上端明显缺失，或許当初此畫也绘有小佛）。</p><p>無論當初此像是何身份，這背負經卷的僧人形象，後來對629到645年間赴印度旅行的著名的玄奘三藏的像，及中國和吐蕃地區在十六羅漢之上增加的帶著老虎的達摩多羅的像，都産生了強烈的影響。有關達摩多羅的種種混同和變形，戴密微教授有詳細的論述（參見饒宗頤《敦煌白畫》，1978年，43-49頁）。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 60"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.157</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Yu receiving the writings of the Luo River</title><title lang="chi-Hant">禹受洛書傳說圖</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 9th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on paper</p><p>H.45.5 cm, W.37.0 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting 157. Ch. 00150</p><p>Of all the paintings found at Dunhuang, this one remains perhaps the most mysterious. When found, as can be seen from Stein’s illustration (Serindia, Pl. CI), two woodcut prints of Avalokitesvara (Pl. 81 and Fig. 140) had been pasted onto it, covering everything except the string of cash.</p><p>In the drawing, the string of cash lies in the foreground. On the right, an official inscribes a tablet while facing and apparently listening to the great dragon that kneels in front of him. The dragon has the hooves of a horse; the official too has a hoof instead of a foot, though only a small part of it is now visible. In fact it would appear that the drawing, which exhibits a join down the centre, has been considerably cut down on either side. On the left, the hindquarters of the dragon can be seen to be humped up: one hoof of a hind leg is just visible. Of the explanations offered by Waley and Matsumoto, the most plausible is that the scene represents the mythical Emperor Fu Xi receiving the trigrams from the dragon-horse.</p><p>According to legend, Fu Xi received the trigrams from a dragon-horse 龍馬 that appeared out of the Yellow River, bearing them on its back, a parallel with the appearance of a tortoise with writing on its back from the Lo River when Yu was controlling the floods. Apart from the horse’s hooves on the dragon, we may note that on its back it bears three prominent rock-like peaks and a voluminous mane quite unlike those of other dragons. Could this unusual combination in fact represent the Yellow River itself from which the animal appears or are the peaks some allusion to the diagrams on its back?</p><p>Waley himself noted that this explanation was in any case open to the objection that Fu Xi was always represented “with a snake’s body, or at any rate in semimonstrous form”. However, this is quite a different depiction from the usual one of Fu Xi with Nu Wa (see Vol.3), and in any case as the drawing has been cut, we can only guess at the lower part of Fu Xi’s body: all that remains of it is one foot, which, in the plate in Serindia is clearly seen to be another horse’s hoof, and a portion of his robe, which is swept back in an unexpected fashion.</p><p>One last element in the drawing, the string of cash, suggests a different connection with the dragon-horse, for yansheng qian 厭勝錢, or money with auspicious powers to overcome evil, was in the Song dynasty known as 龍馬錢, or dragon-horse money. Such coins, which were in use in the Han dynasty, are said to be described in the Bogu tu 博古圖 as depicting dragons and horses. It seems at least possible that here these auspicious coins are used to identify the dragon-horse in the Fu Xi legend (see Morohashi, Dai Kanwa Jiten, s.v. 17245/182, 3025/37, 48818/516,518).</p><p>Since writing the above, Sarah Allan has kindly suggested that the man seen in the picture, who holds an official’s tablet, may in fact be Yu, who received the “writings of the Lo” 洛書 from a “sacred tortoise” while he was still an official under Yao. Yu’s labours and extensive travels in controlling the waters left him permanently disabled, so that while “the tracks of Yu” is a synonym for the whole of China, “the step of Yu” is used of people who are lame. What might then be represented here is therefore a fusion of several elements, namely Yu as official, with a hoof to represent his lameness, recording the “writings of the Lo” on his tablet, but getting them from the dragon-horse, to whom the coins are also an allusion, and whose back seems here to bear mountains and floods. The secret of Yu’s control lay in understanding the nature of water, 禹之制水水之道也. As for the substitution of the dragon-horse for the tortoise, by the late Tang there were many embroidered or garbled versions of ancient legends, and this picture may well be the visual equivalent of such popular stories, the painter having fused the most distinctive elements of two parallel events for greater visual effect.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，9世紀</p><p>紙本設色</p><p>高45.5釐米 寬37.0釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫 157.Ch.00150</p><p>在敦煌發現的繪畫中，可以說此畫是最神秘的作品。發現當初，就像《西域》（參見《西域》，圖101）中所見圖版那樣，上面貼著兩幅文殊菩薩的木版畫（圖81和Fig.140），下部除帶孔錢幣以外，其餘完全被隱蓋。</p><p>這幅畫的前景是用繩索穿著的帶孔錢幣，右方站著官人，傾聽前面跪著的一條大龍的訴説，並用筆記在笏上。龍爪似馬蹄，官人的腳雖然現在只殘留了前面的一點，但也仍可看出是馬蹄的形狀。畫面的中央部位可見紙的接縫，因此當時畫的兩側可能被切掉了相當的部分。龍的背向左上方隆起，左下角還可以略微窺到後腳的蹄。在Waley及松本博士介紹此畫的說明中，最有說服力的，就是表現了古代傳說中伏羲皇帝從龍馬那裏獲得八卦的場面。</p><p>根據傳說，伏羲是從黃河中出現的背負圖表的龍馬處獲得八卦的。這與大禹治水時，從洛河中出現背負文書的龜的傳說屬同一類型。此龍引人注目的除馬蹄外，還有不見於其他龍的背上三處山岩樣的東西及其濃密鬃毛。這異常的組合，是要由此表示此動物出現在黃河嗎？那山岩一樣的東西暗示龍背上背的是圖表嗎？</p><p>Waley認爲，此說明存在一個問題，即伏羲通常是“人首蛇身，或至少也應是半獸身”。然而，此圖中的人物形象與通常的《伏羲女媧圖》（見第3卷）完全不同。而此圖中伏羲的下半身，由於畫面被切掉了，我們只能想象，現在殘留的只是一隻腳的腳尖。但從《西域》的圖版中可以辯認出另一只馬蹄，還可見風吹向後方變形的衣襟。</p><p>此畫中的另一個重要構成是用繩索串起來的硬幣，可能另有深意，即具有驅惡壓邪吉兆之力的厭勝錢，在宋代被稱爲龍馬錢。在《博古圖》中記載，漢代使用的這種硬幣上繪有龍和馬。因此，可以認爲，這也是那种有吉兆的硬幣，至少可以起到了表明伏羲傳說中确定龍馬的作用（參照《諸橋大漢和辭典》17245/182，3025/37，48818/516，518）。</p><p>就在我寫完上述內容時，Sarah Allan友好地提示：此圖中表現手持笏的男子也許是大禹。禹在奉侍堯帝時，從“靈龜”那裏得到了“洛書”。禹爲治水，不停勞作，又走訪廣大地域，造成終身殘疾。致使“禹迹”這個詞成爲中國全境的同意語，“禹步”這個詞也被用來指的腿腳不靈便的人。因此可以認爲，此畫中的人物是融合了幾個要素的，即禹被表現爲官人的形象，腿腳的不便用馬蹄表現。禹將“洛書”錄在手持的笏上，但那傳授“洛書”的是龍馬。錢幣暗示此動物是龍馬，背上的是山和洪水。這種解釋也能成立。據說禹治水的秘訣，就是 “禹之制水水之道也”。至於以靈龜代替龍馬這一點，到了晚唐時，對古代的傳說有很多都進行了潤色和改變，此畫也與此相同，將兩件事畫入同一個畫面上，將兩者最具特徵的要素組合了起來，獲得更大視覺效果。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 61">-<msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.170</idno></msIdentifier>-<msContents>+<msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Talisman of the Pole-star</title><title lang="chi-Hant">北方神星·計都星像護符</title>-<note lang="eng"><p>Five Dynasties, mid-10th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on paper</p><p>H. 42.7cm, W. 30.0 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting170.

Avalokitesvara and Ksitigarbha were evidently closely linked at Dunhuang: besides the present frontispiece, we may note a painting on silk in the Pelliot collection (Bannieres, No.119), where a six-armed Avalokitesvara is shown side by side with Ksitigarbha above a series of individual representations of the Ten Kings at their desks; and two paintings dated A.D. 981 and A.D.983 (Bannieres, Nos. 103, 116), which, were it not for a disparity in size, would almost appear as a pair. The first is a Thousand-armed Avalokitesvara in which Ksitigarbha also appears below, opposite the male donor. The second has Ksitigarbha as the principal figure, and a Bodhisattva as Guide of Souls, very much in the likeness of Avalokitesvara, leading the way for the female donor.</p><p>Clearly, devout Buddhists of the late tenth century had equal faith in the abilities of Ksitigarbha and Avalokitesvara to lead them out of evil ways, and Yinlu pusa, the Bodhisattva who leads the way, has something of both in his composition.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>五代時期，10世紀</p><p>紙本設色</p><p>斷簡全圖：高30.0 釐米 寬56.0 釐米</p><p>斯坦因繪畫 78.Ch.00404</p><p>參考Fig.91</p><p>本圖是《十王經》（僞經，即中國撰述的經典之一）卷首封皮画断片的一部分。断片全圖是刊载的Fig.91。此封皮圖由地藏图和觀音图構成，最开头描绘的是上方的兩手分別托著日輪（已經缺失）和月輪的六臂觀音。但在此处，好像地藏一方比观音受重视。地藏的兩侧，各縱排有十王中的五位，右側五王的後面站著兩位供養人，左側的供養人，有一身伴有“善童子一心供養”记录的长方形题笺，只剩下上半個身子。</p><p>根據Ledderose (1981)教授提出的圖像學的發展階段來看，此地藏圖中所見的十王表現手法，應當與圖23中的地藏十王圖是在同一階段。十王是作爲一個整體表現的，尚沒有具備各自的特徵。在敦煌，觀音和地藏有著非常密切的關係，除本圖的封皮畫外，伯希和藏品中保留的幾幅作品也能證明。如伯希和收集的絹畫上，十王分別在自己的桌前，圖上方可見地藏菩薩和十一面六臂觀音菩薩是並排表現的（參照伯希和圖錄《敦煌的幡和繪畫》篇圖版119）。再，有太平興國六年（981年）和太平興國八年紀年的兩幅作品（參照伯希和圖錄《敦煌的幡和繪畫》篇圖版錄103、116），儘管大小不同，但觀音和地藏兩菩薩都是組合一起表現的。前者是《千手千眼觀世音菩薩圖》，但在下段的男供養人像相對的位置上畫著地藏菩薩。後者是《地藏十王圖》，在下部描繪的却是作爲引路菩薩的引領女供養人們的觀音。這些是因爲10世紀末的佛教徒們，將能夠救度自己于恶道的地藏和觀音，都报着同等信仰的心。可以看到組合两者的部分特點而构成的例子。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 63"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.80</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Illustrations to the Ten Kings Sutra</title><title lang="chi-Hant">地藏十王圖斷簡（局部）</title><note lang="eng"><p>Five Dynasties, 10th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on paper</p><p>H. 27.8 cm, L. 239.9 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting 80. Ch.cii. 001</p><p>As already mentioned in the notes to Pl. 22, the handscrolls depicting the Ten Kings, each holding court separately, are a late development in the iconography of Ksitigarbha, replacing the Bodhisattva as the main subject. In this handscroll, which is fragmentary, Ksitigarbha only appears at the end, with a number of souls advancing towards him in hope of release from the torments of hell.</p><p>The five kings are each represented in the same fashion, seated behind a draped table and attended by the Good and Bad Boys (the recorders of the good and evil deeds of a person during his life), and by lectors and gaolers who drive the souls before the court. Some souls wear wooden cangues and hand fetters; they are clad in only a loincloth, and in one scene one of them is being held down by two gaolers and beaten. The virtuous, on the other hand, are clothed in tenth century costume: the men hold bundles of scrolls, the women small seated images of the Buddha, in token of their meritorious deeds (Pl. 63-1). One of these scrolls is unrolled, its end falling to the ground in a charming detail in front of the last king at the point where it is decided in which of the Six Ways the soul will be reborn (Pl. 63-3). Both before and after this there are breaks in the scroll, and the remaining five kings (including Yama, the fifth king) are missing. The scroll resumes again with an actual scene of Hell, represented as a black-walled city, with flaming corner towers on which sit small dogs. Inside, a figure lies pinioned on a bed; outside, demons with horse and ox heads pursue figures begging Ksitigarbha’s help. The Bodhisattva stands in monk’s robes, holding his staff and alms bowl (Pl. 63-4).</p><p>There is no text to accompany the scenes in this scroll and no background to the figures of each scene. The stiffened ribbons of the men’s caps and the single hairpin worn by the women indicate a date early in the tenth century, or at the earliest at the very end of the ninth. The artist, not at ease with the naked figures of condemned souls, was capable of some lively effects in the draped figures, such as the woman seen from behind in the foreground of the last king and the flouncing sleeves of the kings themselves.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>五代時期，10世紀</p><p>紙本設色</p><p>高27.8 釐米 長239.9 釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫 80.Ch.cii.001</p><p>依據前面圖22的解說中所述，根據Lothar Ledderose教授的圖像學的發展階段而言，十王用各自獨立畫面描繪的連續畫卷，是地藏十王圖後期的一種表現形式，主角從地藏菩薩替代爲十王。此畫卷（斷片）上，地藏只在卷末出現，衆多的亡者們爲祈願逃離地獄之苦正向地藏的方向靠近。</p><p>此畫卷上看到的五王的表現，都是坐在蓋有桌布的桌子前面，旁邊有善童子、惡童子（生前所做善惡事的記錄者），前庭伴有驅趕亡靈的獄吏等相同的形式。亡靈中有戴著頸枷、手枷的，他們都是只圍著腰布的形象，有的被兩位獄吏摁坐在地，用棒毆打。其他積有德行的人，以著10世紀時代的衣裝的貴人形象表現，男的捧著包有經卷的包袱，女的捧坐佛的雕像，以示他們的善行（參照圖63-1）。亡靈來世轉生爲六道（參照圖63-2）中的哪一道，決定于十王的最後一位，五道轉輪王的前面，經卷被展開，其一端垂落在地上。此場面前後的紙已經脫落，剩下的五王（包括第五王閻魔王）都缺失了。此畫的最後部分，描繪的是用黑色牆壁圍起來的地獄，被火焰包圍的望樓上坐著一隻小犬。牆的內側可見床上綁著亡靈，外側有被牛頭馬面的異形人追趕，向地藏菩薩靠近祈求救度的亡靈們。地藏菩薩是身披袈裟，手持錫杖和鐵缽的比丘形象（參照圖63-4）。</p><p>根據Ledderose (1981)教授提出的圖像學的發展階段來看，此地藏圖中所見的十王表現手法，應當與圖23中的地藏十王圖是在同一階段。十王是作爲一個整體表現的，尚沒有具備各自的特徵。在敦煌，觀音和地藏有著非常密切的關係，除本圖的封皮畫外，伯希和藏品中保留的幾幅作品也能證明。如伯希和收集的絹畫上，十王分別在自己的桌前，圖上方可見地藏菩薩和十一面六臂觀音菩薩是並排表現的（參照伯希和圖錄《敦煌的幡和繪畫》篇圖版119）。再，有太平興國六年（981年）和太平興國八年紀年的兩幅作品（參照伯希和圖錄《敦煌的幡和繪畫》篇圖版錄103、116），儘管大小不同，但觀音和地藏兩菩薩都是組合一起表現的。前者是《千手千眼觀世音菩薩圖》，但在下段的男供養人像相對的位置上畫著地藏菩薩。後者是《地藏十王圖》，在下部描繪的却是作爲引路菩薩的引領女供養人們的觀音。這些是因爲10世紀末的佛教徒們，將能夠救度自己于恶道的地藏和觀音，都报着同等信仰的心。可以看到組合两者的部分特點而构成的例子。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 64"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Library</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.3961</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Illustrations to the Ten Kings Sutra</title><title lang="chi-Hant">十王經畫卷</title><note lang="eng"><p>Northern Song dynasty, mid- to late 10th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on paper</p><p>H. 28.0cm, L.approx.495.0 cm</p><p>British Library, Stein 3961</p><p>This scroll is depicted in even more detail than the preceding one, but the execution is by a much less accomplished artist, who seems only to have been truly at home with the rudimentary landscape settings below some of the scenes.

At the beginning of the scroll there appears a messenger on a black horse (Pl. 64-2). This is in accordance with a passage from the sutra about Preparatory Practice for the Ten Kings and Life during the Seven Weeks: “Yama the dharma king addressed the Buddha saying: Ye World-Honoured One! I and all the other kings must send a messenger riding on a black horse, holding a black banner, and dressed in black clothes to inspect the merits performed by the families of the deceased. Then he will find their personal documents, and he will release the sinners in accordance with our vow.” (Dainihou zokuzokyo 大日本続藏経 I/23/4, based on a printed Korean version of A.D.1469, translated by Lothar Ledderose, paper read in Cleveland, March 1981.)</p><p lang="chi-Hant">閻羅法王白佛曰世尊我諸王皆當發使乘黑馬 把黑幡着黑衣檢亡人造何功德准名秋陳抽出罪人不違誓願</p><p>Ksitigarbha is seen twice in this scroll: seated in a building where the fifth king, Yama, is judging a sinner being shown his past crimes in a mirror and standing at the end in a hell scene (Pl.64-5) which is almost a reversal of that seen in Pl. 63. There must have been many such scrolls: another in the Bibliothèque Nationale (Pelliot chinois 2870 R) resembles the British Library scroll, having the messenger with his black horse and banner at the beginning of the scroll, after a frontispiece. In the two scrolls shown here, the means of depiction appears to be the same, with the main outlines of the figures executed with a wooden pen, and colours and washes added with the brush.

In Fig. 92, all the pages are shown as arranged by Grinstead, following the order of the sutra. The last few pages are not illustrated, and furnish the text of the short Dicang pusa jing 地藏菩薩経, proof, if any were needed, of the very close association of the two Bodhisattvas Avalokitesvara and Ksitigarbha in the minds of the faithful at Dunhuang at the end of the Tang dynasty.</p><p>Plate 65-1 shows two pages (20v and 21r).

To those who must be saved in (the shape of) a Diamond-holding god, he appears as a Diamond-holding god and preaches to them the Law. (Kato, 1971,p.409.)</p><p>On the left-hand page, the believer kneels in front of a Vajrapani, who, though seated, has all the features, down to the clenched big toe, of the Vajrapani already seen on the silk banner in Vol. 1, Pl. 58.

Such an arrangement is familiar in later block-printed Buddhist and secular narrative illustration, and is also seen in the famous Kako genzai inga kyo 過去現在因果経 scrolls in Japan.

The Buddha, his hands in vitarka-mudra, is more solidly three-dimensional than Sui parallels in the cave paintings. His fully round face and the stylized folds of his robes seem to place him closer to the High Tang Buddhas on the east wall of Cave 103 than to the early Tang group on the east wall of Cave 322 (Chugoku Sekkutsu, Tonko Makkokutsu, vol.3, Pls. 19, 156).

They have been studied in an article by Jean-Pierre Drège (1979) with diagrams to illustrate the various ways in which a sheet of paper might be folded to form the pages of a booklet, usually with the corners cut or rounded off. The folded pages might be pasted together along the edge of the fold, or sewn, or even left separate as appears to have been the case with the booklet from the British Library illustrating the Guanyin jing (Pl. 65, Fig. 92). In the case of another booklet (Fig. 93), also from the British Library Stein collection, the folded leaves were given a cover extending round the back, and then the whole assembly was fastened together with a braided cord passing through three holes in similar fashion to later Chinese books. The resulting booklets are mostly pocket-sized, convenient for carrying around. One example of this is the rubbing of Ouyang Xun’s Huadusi bei 化度寺碑 (Fig. 97). Three folded leaves survive, giving twelve pages, of which the first two are in Paris and the remaining ten in the British Library. The rubbing, made on thin paper, was cut into strips and pasted on the pages so as to read consecutively. The margins were blackened with ink so as to match the rubbing, except along the centre fold, were each leaf is pasted to the next.</p><p>The painting shown in this plate was the frontispiece of a booklet of the Diamond Sutra (金剛般若波羅蜜経 Jin gang pan ruo po luo mi jing). The monk kneeling in front of the Buddha and his retinue of attendants must be Subhuti, and the composition is essentially the same as that of the famous printed frontispiece to the scroll of the Diamond Sutra dated A.D. 868 (Fig. 144). From a similar booklet in the Pelliot collection (P. 4096,see Jao Tsong-yi, 1978, Pls. XLⅥ, XLⅦ), we can see that this frontispiece did not come at the very beginning, but followed depictions of eight Vajra kings. The British Museum leaf is an isolated one, but on the back there appears the last of these Vajra kings, with the inscription “The eighth great spiritual Vajra who receives requests”.

Ch. 00211</p><p>Of this booklet only the cover and one loose page found inside it remain; they are shown side by side in this plate. The cover is of purple cotton, finely woven in a diaper pattern, and with the sides and top and bottom edges all turned in and pasted down to prevent fraying. As can be seen in the plate, the front cover has an extra strip of the same material, sewn to it and folded so as to enclose the back cover when the book was shut. This strip and the whole front cover are stiffened with an endpaper, pasted in, and of double thickness behind the folded strip. The paper is ruled, and towards the left bears the characters 八金剛名 “Eight Vajrapanis” and the remains of streamers and scarves of a figure from the first left-hand page. Probably the booklet began with figures of the Eight Vajrapanis, as in some other examples already mentioned in the notes to Pl. 67.</p><p>The loose page clearly shows where was originally pasted in a booklet along a 5 mm strip down the right side. At the top a strengthening tab extends beyond this to the right, and it was clearly at one time pasted behind the endpaper. Since this page with its finely executed painting was once attached in this way on the right and is now damaged in all the same places as the back cover, it must for a long time have been the only contents of the cover. In other words, it would seem that the cover of a Diamond Sutra booklet was adapted to serve as protection for this picture alone, without any text.</p><p>The painting is, in miniature, very similar to a larger painting in the Pelliot collection (Bannieres, No. 202) and to another booklet in the same collection, with a page of text as well (EO 3566). Marici, holding a fan, descends with her two attendants on a purple cloud towards a kneeling couple in late ninth or early tenth century dress at the right. The whole scene is set over the sea, with a beautifully depicted range of hills and trees at the top of the picture, and rays radiating from the sun disc in the upper left corner.</p><p>As Eiichi Matsumoto has pointed out, the iconography of this scene preserves the flavour of an earlier time, before the majority of Chinese three-headed, six-armed forms of the goddess. This would seem to bear out what can be deduced from intrinsic features of the composition, such as the headdresses of the attendants and their sensitive grouping round Marici, which seems to reflect earlier ninth century conventions, although the kneeling donors can hardly date before the end of the Tang.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐末～五代初期，9世紀末～10世紀初</p><p>紙本設色</p><p>图案部分：高14.3 釐米  寬10.0 釐米</p><p>斯坦因繪畫 207.Ch.00211</p><p>此冊子本只剩下封皮和夾在裏面的一張紙，圖版中是橫著並排顯示的。封皮是用織有細小的菱形花紋的赤紫色棉布作成的，上下和斷面部分的邊緣爲防止開綻而向裏折疊，並用漿糊粘貼。圖版展示的封皮，右側爲書脊，左側爲開口，開口上縫著相同布的細布條，合上書時其繞過封皮紙，整本書就完全合上了。其封皮和細布條的裏面，貼著封皮的襯紙，又在細布條處粘了一張紙。襯紙上畫有格線，左邊寫著“八金剛名”。其左邊相對頁上的畫，還殘留有佛像天衣的一部分。可能此冊子本與上圖解說中舉出的，在卷首畫有八大金剛像的一些例子，同屬一類。</p><p>圖版左側，是脫落的畫的部分，其右側還可見寬約5毫米的塗了漿糊的痕迹。根據上部殘留的固定此畫右側的加固材料，可以斷定此畫是粘在冊子本最後的。而此畫的破損方式和封皮的破損方式大體一致，可以想象，在相當早的時候，其他的部分就丟失了，在很長一段時間裏，就只剩下這一頁夾在封皮裏面。換言之，此《金剛經》冊子的封皮，在很長一段時間裏沒有伴隨經文，而只起到了保護這一頁畫的作用。</p><p>此圖幅面非常小，構圖與伯希和收集品中的大畫面的圖（參照伯希和圖錄《敦煌的幡和繪畫》篇圖版第202圖）以及同收藏品冊子本（EO3566）中的一頁很相似。手持麈尾的摩利支天與兩侍女，乘着赤紫色雲，向跪著男女供養人的畫面右下角方向下降，男女供養人身著9世紀末到10世紀初的衣裳。場面設定在海上，畫面的上方繪有遠景的山、森林等。再有，左上角繪有日輪，從那裏放射出紅色的光線。</p><p>正如松本博士所指出的，此画的圖像表現手法殘留著較早時期的特點，是用三頭六臂或八臂表現摩利支天的密教形成之前的。事實上，此圖的摩利支天和侍女們的構成方式、侍女們的髮型等基本的表現手法，可以確認是遵循了9世紀初的慣例，但右下角跪著的供養人像的表現方法，很難認爲是唐代末期以前的。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 69"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.208</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Two Devarajas, folios 2v-3r</title><title lang="chi-Hant">二天王像（佛說迴向輪經扉畫）</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 9th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on paper</p><p>Each leaf approx.

Ch. 00197</p><p>The wall paintings at the Caves of the Thousand Buddhas are so rich in splendid and varied compositions, on which attention has mostly been focused, that the walls actually representing the Thousand Buddhas have been somewhat neglected. Their full effect, in ranks with regular alternation of colour, in some of the caves covering all four walls and the ceiling, can only be felt by the traveller who is able to visit the caves in person. It is a sight and experience he is unlikely to forget, and he will find it in caves of every date at Dunhuang, from the fifth to the tenth or eleventh centuries.</p><p>Fortunately this great wealth of simple figures of the Buddha has stayed in place, where they can have such an impact on the beholder. But among the material from the Stein collection, there are some links with the Thousand Buddhas on the walls of Dunhuang. One link is provided by the stencils shown in Pls. 78-80 and by further examples in the Pelliot collection, for example, P. 4517 (2), (3), (4), (5), which were probably actually used to produce the wall paintings. Another is the series of paintings of single figures of the Buddha, such as that shown here (Figs. 122-33). There is some evidence that this series, although pasted on paper, was in fact intended to decorate a wall, since, as Stein reported in Serindia, “all have been pasted flat on a stucco surface and are stiff with remains of clay …. The paintings had been made in a series on pieces of paper pasted together in strips, and were afterwards cut up into separate pictures; but the tracing has been badly adjusted, as the join almost always comes in the middle of a figure”. Three examples from the Pelliot collection show why (Bannières, Nos. 44-46): each depicts three figures one above the other. In two the join across the central figure clearly shows, and in these there is also an alternation of colours in the robe, nimbus, lotus petals and so on, those of the top and bottom figures corresponding and distinct from those of the central figure.</p><p>The Buddhas in the Stein collection are from a different series, without the flowers that adorn the Pelliot examples. However, it is easy to establish that they too were originally arranged in threes, with a join visible in the central figure, always the one in a dark brown robe, seated on a lotus with pink petals, as in this colour plate. Those above and below wear a red robe, are seated on a lotus with uncoloured petals, and show no join in the paper. Since the Stein series has eight Buddhas in dark brown robes (all with the join) and six in red robes (with no join), it can be seen that there must have been many more originally. One more in a red robe is in New Delhi (Ch. 00402) and bears traces of Tibetan characters upside down, possibly suggesting that the paper had been re-used. The drawing is simple and the writing identifying each Buddha very rough, but the figures do not appear to be later than ninth century in date. They must have formed a frieze, three Buddhas high, stuck to the walls of a cave chapel.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，9世紀</p><p>紙本設色</p><p>高26.8釐米 寬22.8釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫 186.Ch.00197</p><p>對于敦煌千佛洞的壁畫，出版物最初注重的大多集中于壯麗、構圖富於變化的大画面壁畫本身，而忽視描繪千佛的壁面。千佛虽然色彩變化是規则的，排成几行几段，有的窟裏從四壁到天井都被千佛遮蔽了，其壯觀，不親自去拜訪千佛洞是無法體味的。访问實地，可以见到從5世紀到11世紀的各年代洞窟中的千佛，恐怕其難以忘懷的光景，会总在眼前闪烁。</p><p>所幸的是，這種千佛的壁畫至今還留在當地，使來訪者受到震憾。但是斯坦因收集品中，也能找出一些與敦煌這種千佛壁畫有聯繫的。其中之一就是圖78至80中的紙樣。結合伯希和收集的各例來看，比如P.4517(2)、(3)、(4)、(5)，大概紙樣是實際用於壁畫製作的。另外一種就是像本圖的這樣，描繪著佛的單像的一系列的繪畫（參照Figs.122-133）。這些畫都用紙做了背襯，實際上是裝飾牆壁的。對於此，斯坦因在《西域》中敍述：“全都貼在灰泥上，上面附著的粘土已變得堅硬……將紙縱向粘合，畫上一連串的畫，然後再分別裁開。但是像和紙接縫處的間隔沒調整好，幾乎每個系列中都有一些像的中間部位有紙的接縫。”看一下伯希和收集品中的三例畫像，此間的情況便可明白。Bannières的圖版44-46都是三尊佛像豎著排列，其中兩例，中央像的正中部位有橫向的紙的接縫。再，這些佛的衣服、身光、蓮花座等顔色的組合是變化的，上段和下段的佛像是相照應的，而中間的像和它們不同，顔色不相合。</p><p>斯坦因收集的系列佛像中，沒有伯希和收集品中見到的那種花的裝飾，明顯是另外組成的系列。但這些原本也是三尊佛像縱著排列的，中間的像上可見紙的接縫。如本圖的像，著暗褐色衣服，坐在淡紅色花瓣的蓮花寶座上的像上都有紙的接縫，是中央部位的像。上邊和下邊的佛像沒有紙的接縫，著紅衣，坐在沒有彩色的蓮花座上的像的位置。現在大英博物館中，著暗褐色衣服的像（都有接縫）有八尊，著紅衣的像（無接縫）有六尊。可以推測，原先還應有很多這樣的佛像。新德里國立博物館中也有一尊著紅衣的像（Ch.00402），本来应该有更多的像。新德里博物館的藏品上，還帶有倒著書寫的藏文，可能這显示了紙張的再利用，與像本身無直接的關係。描绘簡略，附在各像上的名字也寫得潦草，但佛像看起來不會是9世紀以後的。這些畫可能是三尊组合豎著貼在石窟壁上的。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate74"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.71</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Bhaisajyaguru with Cintamanicakra and Vajragarbha</title><title lang="chi-Hant">藥師如來、如意輪觀音、金剛藏菩薩像</title><note lang="eng"><p>Five Dynasties, mid-10th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on paper</p><p>H.84.0 cm, W. 76.5 cm</p><p>Stein painting71. Ch. xxi. 0015</p><p>The inconsistencies of this painting have been discussed by Arthur Waley in his Catalogue. As the central Buddha holds a beggar’s staff and bowl, he would normally be identified as Bhaisajyaguru, accompanied by the Bodhisattvas of Sunlight and Moonlight. In this case, however, these figures have been labelled Cintamanicakra (on the Buddha’s left) and Vajragarbha. Waley concludes that the painter took a Bhaisajyaguru triad as model and simply added the names of the Esoteric figures without bothering to alter the iconography to suit them.</p><p>There is no doubt about the tenth century date of this painting, given the general simplification of the features, the squarish outline to the face, the sharply hooked mouthline and the large size of the attendant figures, which fill most of the available space.</p><p>In one respect concerning its mounting, this painting appears to be unique. A relatively large painting on paper, it is formed of six sheets pasted together before painting and backed with coarse hemp cloth. On the reverse, the hemp cloth was again lined with paper (also six sheets pasted together), and this in turn was attached with animal glue to a wooden lattice with almost square apertures (each H. 10.5 cm, W. 9.5 cm). A flower was painted in each square aperture, the classic combinations of blue with red and green with violet alternating in each row and column. An ink centre was added for each outer petal, and each flower is also outlined in red; the squares in which they are placed are framed in a darker red. The glue lies over these framing lines so that it is certain that the spaces were ruled (probably using the lattice itself as a guide) and the flowers painted before the painting was actually glued in place. The wooden lattice itself was composed of timber approximately 3 cm wide. The flowers recall the actual cut paper flowers also found at Dunhuang (see Vol.3) and bring to mind other floral motifs of the Tang, such as the flowers on the ceiling of the corridor leading to the burial chamber in Princess Yongtai’s tomb (Tang Yongtai gongzhu mu bihua ji, Fig. 2). The painting must have been carefully removed from its window to be deposited in the sealed library and is thus an interesting witness to the deliberate way in which the deposit was made and sealed.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>五代時期,10世紀中葉</p><p>紙本設色</p><p>高84.0釐米  寬76.5釐米</p><p>斯坦因繪畫71.Ch.xxi.0015</p><p>有關此畫的如下幾處矛盾，Arthur Waley在敦煌畫目錄中已指出。即中尊持錫杖和缽，通常認爲是藥師如來，其脇侍應是日光和月光兩菩薩，但本圖中的脇侍卻分別標爲如意輪菩薩和金剛藏菩薩。對此Arthur Waley推論，畫是以藥師三尊爲原型，圖像未加任何變動，只是像名取自密教像。</p><p>此圖的全部描繪簡略，從臉部為方型、嘴角描繪成鈎形、兩脇侍畫得大到了幾乎佔滿了空白等看，考慮爲10世紀的作品大概不會有錯。</p><p>此畫在構造上也極獨特。它作爲紙畫是相當大的，描繪在六張事先粘合的紙上,還用粗麻布作了裱襯，在背面粗麻上又貼上紙（與正面相同也是六張）。再用動物膠粘上約成正方形（每個高10.5釐米，寬9.5釐米）的方格架。方格中是青與紅、綠與紫色組合的古典的彩色花紋，縱橫交錯配置。花紋全部外側的花瓣，均用紅線圈括，採用了墨點相連的暈圈式染色的方法。那方形的圍框是用深紅褐色勾勒。但此線上還殘留著膠，這可能是分割花紋空間的線（也許是只直接粘方格架的）。花紋可能實際上在此畫裝方格架之前，就已經畫在線框內了。方格架是由寬約3cm的四棱木材做成。此花紋又使人聯想起在敦煌發現的剪紙花，同時也想起像永泰公主墓墓道天井的那種唐代的裝飾紋樣等（參照《唐永泰公主墓壁畫》插圖2）。</p><p>爲將此畫放進石室，要非常小心地從方格架上摘下來。這種製作、收藏時細緻周到的工作，是相當精巧而令人讚嘆的。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 75"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.177</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Six female spirits to protect children</title><title lang="chi-Hant">護諸童子女神像（護符）</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 9th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on paper</p><p>Each leaf: H. 33.0 cm, W. 8.0 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting 177 (1-3).

Under the sixteen major spirits there are numerous small yakshas, who may rob children of their spiritual essence. If you want your small boys and girls to be without sickness and pain, you must always sacrifice to the spirit concerned. Then your small children will recover their health. (Trans., Waley, 1931,p.172.)</p><p>Below this another inscription identifies the particular spirit:</p><p>This female spirit’s name is Moyizhe.

The figure of the spirit is outlined in ink and then coloured with a broad band of blue just inside the outline. As a result, white spaces are left on the thighs, knee and so on. This method of figure painting was commonly employed for demons in China, often giving them the appearance of jointed puppets, as in a fragment from a Uighur scroll from Chotscho in ink in Berlin (Bussagli, 1963, p. 108). An impish figure in the procession of Zhongkui and his wife by Gong Kai in the Freer Gallery of Art is an extreme case, with body and limbs entirely black, but each joint and segment clearly separate from the next (Lawton, 1973, p. 143).</p><p>The remaining female spirits on these three leaves are similarly depicted together with an afflicted child, and with an inscription in Chinese and a briefer inscription in Khotanese.

As can be seen from the monochrome plate of the whole (Fig. 138), it shows a complete group with central Buddha, two Bodhisattvas and two monk disciples. Only the figures of the Buddha and of the attendants on his left are drawn in ink. To produce the attendants on the Buddha’s right, the whole (assembled from several smaller sheets of paper) was folded down the middle and holes were pricked following the ink outlines, right through both layers of paper. Close examination easily reveals the direction in which this was done.</p><p>The stencil was used for the production of repeated designs such as are seen in Cave 61 at Dunhuang itself. There a very similar five-figure group appears on each of the four faces of the ceiling, completely surrounded by smaller individual Buddhas taking up exactly half the height of the central group. The design was transferred to the wall by introducing a reddish powder (tuhong 土紅), found locally, through the holes. After removing the stencil the small marks left on the wall could then easily be joined up to form the design. Traces of this powder can still be seen on the front surface of the stencil, showing that it was actually used. There is therefore a possibility that the wall paintings produced through its use may still exist in the Dunhuang caves.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>五代～北宋初期，10世紀中葉</p><p>紙、墨畫、針孔線</p><p>整體紙樣：高79.0釐米  寬141.0釐米</p><p>斯坦因繪畫 72.Ch.00159</p><p>參照Fig138</p><p>敦煌的紙樣中，這是最大的也是最漂亮的，而且有實際被使用過的痕迹。Fig.138可見紙樣的全圖。佛坐於中央，其兩邊是兩比丘和兩菩薩。佛與左側的比丘、菩薩是用墨畫的。右側的像，則是將整幅畫（將六張紙粘接在一起）從中心線對折後，用針沿著墨線紮出的許多小孔穿透兩層紙而得到的。因此，這種作品，研究一下就能知道哪一側是先畫上去的。</p><p>紙樣是用來製作類似敦煌第61窟那種，相同圖案反復出現的壁畫。第61窟的天井四周，繪的是與此非常相似的五尊佛，周圍密密麻麻地圍滿了只有其一半高的小如來群即千佛。紙樣的圖案，是用本地出產的叫土紅的一種紅色的粉末摹寫在壁上。在紙樣上塗上這種粉末，粉末就會透過針孔沾在牆上，描紅以後畫圖就容易了。本圖所示紙樣的正面，現在還殘留著沾的粉末，證明被實際使用過。因此，在敦煌石窟的某個地方，還可能有用此紙樣製作的壁畫。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 79"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.73(1)</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Buddha</title><title lang="chi-Hant">佛坐像紙樣</title><note lang="eng"><p>Five Dynasties or early Northern Song, mid-10 th century A.D.</p><p>Ink on paper, with pricked outlines from another design on the other side</p><p>H.32.5 cm, W. 26.5 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting 73(1).

The figure is not drawn in ink, but the outlines of lotus petals in the nimbus and of wavy lines in the aureole, are picked out in colour and in ink respectively. These lines are of course also pricked. Thus, in transferring the design to the wall the painter could choose between plain nimbus and aureole, and decorated ones, with four possibilities in all (both plain, both decorated, or one plain and one decorated and vice-versa). As with the other stencils, enough remains of the powder on the front surface to testify to frequent actual use, and in addition two register marks in ink at top and bottom presumably mean that it was possible to remove the stencil from the wall to check progress and then replace it.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>五代～北宋初期，10世紀中葉</p><p>紙、針孔線、部分線描</p><p>高55.5釐米  寬38.0釐米</p><p>斯坦因繪畫 73（2）.Ch.xli.004</p><p>此種紙樣與前兩種不同，展示了可以用一種紙樣取得多種圖樣。圖像本身是用針紮孔的方法從別的紙上摹寫過來的，樣式與前二種相似，但比它們大。只有頭光外區的蓮瓣和身光的波狀紋樣，各自沿著針孔線用紅線和墨線區別開。那是畫家使用此紙樣往壁面轉摹圖像時，區別是否畫頭光或身光上的花紋的標準，全部的搭配可以有四種（頭光身光都沒有花紋的、頭光身光都有花紋的、頭光有花紋身光沒花紋的、頭光無花紋身光有花紋的）。和其他紙樣一樣，此紙樣表面上也殘留有證明其被多次實際使用過的土粉的顔色。此外，爲方便多次將紙樣從牆上取下，瞭解進展狀況後再貼回原處時考慮，在上下的中央位置上，用墨作了利於對照的記號。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 81"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.234</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="san">Avalokitesvara</title><title lang="chi-Hant">觀世音菩薩像版畫</title><note lang="eng"><p>Five Dynasties, 10th century A.D.</p><p>Woodblock print, ink with added colour on paper</p><p>H.39.9 cm, W. 17.0 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting 234.

Ch.00421</p><p>Among the woodblock prints from Dunhuang, long rolls with multiple impressions of the Buddha, or of Bodhisattvas, form an important part. In the Pelliot collection at the Bibliotheque Nationale, twelve different kinds have been identified. This plate and Figs. 155-62 show the kinds to be found in the Stein collection at the British Museum. Where possible, these have been reproduced actual size to simplify comparison and give an idea of their effect. Most of them were printed in ink, but some were printed in red and those shown here were enhanced with colour added by hand after printing. In all cases it will be seen that each image was individually printed, causing irregularities and overlaps. In one example (Fig. 156), we have a fascinating glimpse of the devotion that inspired the creation of these celebrations of the omnipresence of the Buddha. The image is a very simple one of the Buddha seated and holding an alms bowl, without nimbus and with only the minimum of detail. A date is written in ink at intervals throughout the surviving fragments of this scroll, which is on thin paper of good quality, possibly eighth century in date. These dates are written after every twenty-one impressions, following the same sequence in every month: the eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, twenty-third, twenty-ninth and thirtieth days of the month. These must have been the fast days of the Buddhist calendar. We can imagine this and other such scrolls being steadily filled up with images, their creation bringing merit for the Buddhist believer who possessed such a stamp, or who brought his scroll to the temple for stamping.</p><p>Despite the gap in time and distance, it is instructive to compare these Dunhuang scrolls with those preserved in Japan from the late Heian period, for instance those from the Joruri-ji (Baskett, 1980, nos. 2-4; Ishida, 1964, Pls. 33ff). These are extremely close in style and appearance to the Dunhuang prints, but there is an important difference in actual execution, for they are not individually stamped but printed in blocks, some in blocks of twelve, others in a block of one hundred. The block of twelve consists of four rows of Buddhas with three in each row. Six impressions on a sheet made a total of seventy-two. With the block of one hundred images each row of ten is similar to the one below it, and it is therefore believed that a block of ten images was first carved, and that ten successive impressions from it were pasted down and carved in a new block of one hundred. This method of creating ten, a dozen or one hundred images at a time is a fascinating example of Japanese adaptation of a form derived from China. It was of course much more efficient, but it could only have developed in the absence of the individual small locks that were used to stamp the Dunhuang scrolls. What the Japanese were following were in fact just such scrolls imported from China: to obtain more it was only necessary to paste a group of impressions together on a block, and carve anew. We can thus explain at once both the astonishing stylistic affinities between the Chinese and Japanese examples of different dates, and the differences in their execution and use (the) Japanese printed sheets were enshrined within statues rather than remaining in constant devotional use).</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代，9世紀</p><p>紙、木版墨印、淡彩</p><p>一版（一身像）：高10.7釐米 寬9.3釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫254.Ch.00421</p><p>敦煌攜來的木版畫中，印刷上多個佛或菩薩像的長卷子本的形式，是非常重要的一類作品。巴黎的法國國立圖書館收藏的伯希和搜集品中，可辨出有12種。大英博物館收藏的斯坦因搜集品中，除本圖外，均展示在Figs.155-162中。單色圖版所示是各木版的原來尺寸，便於查看它們的效果以及相互比較。大部分畫都是墨印的，其中也有赤印的，也有像本圖，印後塗上色彩的。哪一種排列都不整齊，有的歪斜重疊，可以看出像是一尊一尊地印上去的。尤其是Fig.156中千佛的版畫，滲透著創作它的信徒讚歎佛遍滿世界的感情。那佛手持鐵缽端坐，沒有背光，是最小限度地描寫，非常簡潔。印在可能是大約8世紀的上等薄紙上，有些地方還有筆寫的日期。其日期每隔二十一尊就有一次，每月都限在八日、十四日、十五日、二十三日、二十九日、三十日。這些日子可能是佛教徒的齋戒日。不難想象，信徒們認爲持有這樣密密麻麻並排印著佛像的卷子本，就能帶來功德。</p><p>以這些敦煌卷子本，比較淨琉璃寺的木版印刷的千體佛等日本平安時代以後的作品，雖然兩者的時間和地點相差很遠，卻很有意義。這些樣式和體裁上，與敦煌的極相似，但在製作上面，卻有大的區別。這些不是將佛像一尊一尊上印上去的，而是十二尊或一百尊作爲一塊印製的。十二尊的版木上，佛像是三尊一排，共有四排並列，印六次就能印出七十二尊。百尊的版木上，每列有十尊佛，而且每列上的像都是相同的。因此，可以想象，這是先刻出一列有十尊的版木，再用它印出十張貼在木板上，刻出新的百尊的版木。這種一次十尊、十二尊，甚至能印出百尊佛像的方法，在將中國的形式進行日本式改造的事中，是最具魅力的事例之一。毫無疑問，這種方法大大提高了效率。但也可以說，是因为那些敦煌通常用的一尊佛像的小版木沒有傳來，才想出來的。從中國傳來的只有卷子本，爲了得到大量的這種卷子，産生出將一組佛像貼在版木上，將其刻成一塊新的版木的方法。因此，就不難理解，中國和日本不同時期的卷子，卻像上面所述的，在樣式上有著驚人的相似性，同時其製作方法和用途卻有著顯著的不同（在日本，比起日常的信仰，更多地是爲了將其放入佛雕像之胎內）。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 83"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.140</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Tara</title><title lang="chi-Hant">多羅菩薩圖</title><note lang="eng"><p>Period uncertain</p><p>Ink and colours on hemp</p><p>H.66.5 cm, W.40.0 cm</p><p>Stein painting 140.

These scenes and the Tibetan costumes in the painting offer the closest link to other Dunhuang paintings, but, since the style is entirely Tibetan or Nepalese, and in view of the two lamas seen at the top of the painting, the date must be considerably later than the presumed date when Cave 17 was sealed (early in the eleventh century). It has been included here for the sake of completeness.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>年代不詳</p><p>麻布設色</p><p>高66.5釐米  寬40.0釐米</p><p>斯坦因繪畫 140.Ch.lii.001</p><p>此畫看起來與敦煌第17窟帶回的其他作品性質完全不同，但的確是斯坦因從第17窟拿來的。據說在斯坦因到達敦煌以前，繪畫類作品已被王圓籙翻亂了，此畫可能是王圓籙從別的地方拿到第17窟的。</p><p>中央畫著大的多羅菩薩，其左右各排列著四尊共八尊多羅菩薩。空隙中散佈著斷崖墜落圖、觀音伸手救于危難的圖等。從這些危難圖以及菩薩所披的藏式衣裳，雖然可窺出與其他的敦煌畫有密切的關係，但其樣式卻完全是藏式的或尼泊爾式的。而畫面上部的兩尊是喇嘛。從這些特點上看，此畫的製作年代不得不考慮在第17窟封窟（11世紀初）以後。考慮到其比較特殊，且保存完整，在這裏進行了展示。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="Vol. 2 Plate 84"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>The British Museum</repository><collection>Stein Collection</collection><idno type="current">1919,0101,0.38</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="eng">Vaisravana and attendant (fragment)</title><title lang="chi-Hant">毘沙門天與乾闥婆（斷片）</title><note lang="eng"><p>Tang dynasty, 8th century A.D.</p><p>Ink and colours on silk</p><p>Whole fragment: H.74.0 cm, W. 31.0 cm</p><p>British Museum, Stein painting 38. Ch.0069</p><p>This painting has already appeared in Vol. 1, Fig. 111, but on account of its importance, both for iconographic and stylistic reasons, a detail of the fragment is shown here.</p><p>Vaisravana is shown standing in a strictly frontal pose, his right hand firmly grasping a halberd-banner. He wears close-fitting armour, with a leopard skin over the hips and a small sword suspended in front. An animal head, with goat-like horns and well furnished with sharp teeth, gapes at the shoulder.</p><p>Unlike the single figures of Vaisravana that been seen in the banners (Vol. 1, Pl. 65, Figs. 109, 110), the king is here accompanied by a gandharva wearing a leopard-head helmet, with the skin covering both shoulders and knotted at the front. A similar figure is constantly seen in attendance on Vaisravana, for instance in the Bhaisajyaguru paradise (Vol. 1, Pl. 9) where he is playing a pipa (the gandharvas were musicians attendant upon Indra, with apsarasas as their wives). In the present fragment, however, he is carrying by the neck an animal readily identifiable as a mongoose, symbolic of Vaisravana’s original identity as Kuvera, the Indian god of wealth. In his other hand, the gandharva holds a flaming pearl. While the same objects can also be found in the depiction of this figure in a woodblock print dated A.D. 947 (Fig. 153), the life-like depiction of the mongoose in the Stein fragment strongly suggests that it was closely based on an Indian prototype, since the mongoose was not familiar to the Chinese artists, and has shrunk to the point where it is a almost unrecognizable in the print. The type is well known in Indian sculpture from the eighth century onwards, but earlier paintings are of course missing. Consequently this fragment assumes a greater importance, particularly since, from the point of view of style, it almost certainly dates from the eighth century. This will be clear if the brushwork, in accurately drawn fine lines, is compared with that of the large iconographical painting. Details such as the delineation of Vaisravana’s eyes and frowning countenance or the shape of the attendants’ feet correspond rather closely to the same features in the iconographical painting shown on page 306.</p></note><note lang="chi-Hant"><p>唐代（8世紀）</p><p>絹本設色</p><p>斷片全圖：高74.0釐米 寬31.0釐米</p><p>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫 38.Ch.0069</p><p>此畫已收錄在第1卷單色圖版第111圖中，但無論在圖像上還是在樣式上都是非常重要的作品，因此，在這裏将其细部郑重提出。</p><p>毘沙門天正面而立，右手持帶幡長槍。身披緊身合體鎧甲，腰圍豹皮，前面挂著小劍，肩上有頭頂山羊角、張開大口露出尖牙的獸頭。</p><p>與畫著毘沙門天獨像的幡畫（參照第1卷彩色圖版第65圖、單色圖版第109圖、110圖）不同，此處的毘沙門天伴著肩披豹皮在胸前繫結的乾闥婆。與乾闥婆相似的形態，在毘沙門天的眷屬中常常見到，如在藥師淨土變相圖中（參照第1卷彩色圖版第9圖）手持琵琶的形象（乾闥婆，既毘沙門天的妻子天女，又是侍奉帝釋天的樂伎）。在本圖的斷片中，是右手抓著貓鼬的脖子，貓鼬原象徵著毘沙門天在印度作爲財富支配者的俱鞞羅，左手托著火焰寶珠。在有開運四年（947年）紀年的木版畫（請參照單色圖錄第153圖）上，可見到有與此相同的乾闥婆形象，但貓鼬的姿勢卻非常奇特，看上去不像是貓鼬，貓鼬對於中國的畫家來說，沒有見過，是不瞭解的。與其相反，本殘片中所見的貓鼬，實在是栩栩如生，這一點讓人強烈地感覺到此畫是深深地紮根於印度的原型。此形式的像，在8世紀以後的印度雕刻中較常見，但那以前的繪畫當然不存。而此畫從樣式上看大約是8世紀的，可以說是件極其珍貴的作品。說此是8世紀的，將此畫準確流暢的運筆，與同時代大畫面的像比較，自然會明白。此毘沙門天的眼、皺眉的面部表現，再有乾闥婆的腿的表現手法，與散見於釋迦瑞像圖（參照彩色圖版第11圖解說部分的插圖.參照第306頁諸像）中的各部分很相似。</p></note></msItem></msContents></msDescription></body></text></TEI.2>
