The introduction to the printed catalogue is reproduced below and duplicated in Falconer_2002a, which contains the first half, Stein Photos 1-11. A third catalogue (Falconer_2006) will be online in 2006 containing more photographs from HAS found after completion of this initial catalogue.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>The present listing of the photograph collection of Sir Aurel Stein is the result of a number of working visits to Budapest by the cataloguers over three years, 1999-2002. The photographs had not previously been examined in any detail, and the contents of the collection were largely unknown. The first visit, made in 1999, swiftly led to the realisation that the photographic collection was of major importance both for the study of Stein's own career and achievements, and as a resource for the study of early 20th century archaeology in Central Asia and the Middle East. Apart from the size of the collection, which was a good deal larger than initially anticipated, early investigation soon revealed that it held much that was unique and unavailable in other institutions such as the British Library. It was, therefore, decided that as full a listing of this material as possible should be undertaken, and that for convenience, is should parallel the existing catalogue of Stein photographs in the British Library as far as possible.</p><p>The Collection</p><p>&gt;Sir Aurel Stein took up photography in the 1890s and for the remainder of his career it formed an important documentary tool in his archaeological and geographical work. In addition to the use of the medium as a professional tool, Stein used photography extensively to produce illustrations for the popular accounts of his travels, such as Sand-buried Ruins of Khotan and Ruins of Desert Cathay, and there are probably in the region of 20,000 of his photographs surviving in various collections. Of these, the photographs in the Oriental and India Office [note: now named Asia and African Collections] of the British Library are probably the most comprehensive, while significant smaller tranches of material are held in, among other places, the Royal Asiatic Society in London and the Bodleian Library in Oxford. Although a certain amount of duplication exists between these collections and those in the Library of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (and such duplication has been noted in the catalogue where traced), the Budapest collections add an important series of images to Stein's photographic record not available elsewhere. Perhaps the most noteworthy is the very extensive documentation of his First Central Asian Expedition of 1900-01. No photographs from this expedition are held in the British Library, while the Royal Asiatic Society holds only the prints subsequently reproduced in Ancient Khotan. The HAS photographs from the 1900-01 expedition are thus the most comprehensive existing record of this journey, including almost all the subsequent published photographs in addition to many previously unknown views and object photographs, and photo-theodolite panoramas made for surveying purposes. As well as photographs relating to his professional pursuits, the HAS collection holds a wider range of images relating to Stein's personal life than exists in most other archives: the albums containing portraits of family and friends and holidays in England and Europe thus offer an insight into a little-glimpsed side of the explorer's life.</p><p>Catalogue arrangement</p><p>The collection is in the form of albums and loose prints, the latter having been roughly arranged in thematic groupings and stored in envelopes. Some re-arrangement of this loose material has been undertaken in the course of cataloguing and photographs clearly belonging together have been transferred and given new collection numbers. The photographs as presently catalogued now comprise 33 numbered groups, plus an appendix listing Stein's original negatives stored separately in the Microfilm department. A number of the groups consist of multiple parts. For example, Stein Photo 5 consists of three albums plus a miscellaneous batch of loose prints, and the total collection thus comprises Stein Photo 5/1-4. Individual print numbers within collections are enclose din round brackets: thus print 30 in album 2 of Stein Photo 5 is cited as Stein Photo 5/2(30). Stein's own negative reference numbers, where known, are listed within square brackets after the print captions.</p><p>Where available, Stein's own captions to his photographs have been quoted although abbreviations have in general been expanded for the sake of clarity. In the case of uncaptioned photographs for which published versions exists, titles have been taken from the published versions. For this reason in most cases Stein's own spelling of place names has been retained in the catalogue.</p></head><body><msDescription n="12/1(63)"><msIdentifier><settlement>Budapest</settlement><repository>The Library of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences</repository><collection>Stein</collection><idno type="current">Stein Photo 12/1(63)</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem><title lang="eng-Latn">Plate 29A: View up Pa-no-pa Valley, Bogdo-ula Range, from above Lo-t'o-p'u-tzu.

These form an incomplete series of proofs of the illustrations for Stein's Innermost Asia. Stein's numbering, which accords with the plate numbers in that work, has been retained rather than re-numbering the collection in a consecutive sequence. The prints are mounted on two sizes of card; those on larger mounts, which are stored separately from the smaller mount size, are identified by the letter &amp;lsquo;L' following the negative number in square brackets.</p></note><listBibl><bibl><ref target="Stein_1903"/></bibl></listBibl></msItem></msContents></msDescription><msDescription n="15(1)"><msIdentifier><settlement>Budapest</settlement><repository>The Library of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences</repository><collection>Stein</collection><idno type="current">Stein Photo 15(1)</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem><title lang="eng-Latn">Rakaposhi from northern Aliabad Bungalow, enlarged, 8 Sep 1930.
