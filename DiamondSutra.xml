                Lapis Lazuli Texts was started as an original effort aiming to translate a selection
                of important texts from the Chinese Buddhist canon into English. These translations
                are being made for the express purpose of universal free distribution, and may be
                integrated into any collection of texts with little difficulty. Additionally, these
                translations are available in a wide variety of cross-platform formats, such as web
                pages, PDF and DJVU documents, Unicode text files, and machine-readable XML. Due to
                their online format, distribution can continue indefinitely, unencumbered by the
                traditional publishing process.</p><p>CC0 1.0 Universal.</p></head><body><msDescription n="1" type="LLT"><msIdentifier><settlement>London</settlement><repository>British Library</repository><collection>Stein</collection><idno type="current">Or.8210/P.2</idno></msIdentifier><msContents><msItem n="1"><title lang="san">Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra</title><note><p>Translated from Taishō Tripiṭaka volume 8, number 235.</p></note><q lang="eng"><p>1. The cause of the Dharma assembly</p><p>Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was in Śrāvastī, residing
                                in the Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s park, along with a great
                                saṃgha of bhikṣus, twelve hundred and fifty in all. At mealtime, the
                                Bhagavān put on his robe, picked up his bowl, and made his way into
                                the great city of Śrāvastī to beg for food within the city walls.
                                After he had finished begging sequentially from door to door, he
                                returned and ate his meal. Then he put away his robe and bowl,
                                washed his feet, arranged his seat, and sat down.</p><p>2. Elder Subhūti opens the question</p><p>From the midst of the great multitude, Elder Subhūti then arose from
                                his seat, bared his right shoulder, and knelt with his right knee to
                                the ground. With his hands joined together in respect, he addressed
                                the Buddha, saying, “How extraordinary, Bhagavān, is the manner in
                                which the Tathāgata is skillfully mindful of the bodhisattvas, and
                                skillfully instructs and cares for the bodhisattvas! Bhagavān, when
                                good men and good women wish to develop the mind of Anuttarā
                                Samyaksaṃbodhi, how should their minds dwell? How should they pacify
                                their minds?” The Buddha replied, “Excellent, excellent, Subhūti,
                                for it is just as you have said: the Tathāgata is skillfully mindful
                                of the bodhisattvas, and skillfully instructs and cares for the
                                bodhisattvas. Now listen carefully, because your question will be
                                answered. Good men and good women who wish to develop the mind of
                                Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi should dwell thusly, and should pacify their
                                minds thusly.” “Just so, Bhagavān. We are joyfully wishing to hear
                                it.”</p><p>3. The true way of the Great Vehicle</p><p>The Buddha told Subhūti, “Bodhisattva-mahāsattvas should pacify their
                                minds thusly: ‘All different types of sentient beings, whether born
                                from eggs, born from wombs, born from moisture, or born from
                                transformation; having form or no form; having thought, no thought,
                                or neither thought nor no thought—I will cause them all to become
                                liberated and enter Remainderless Nirvāṇa.’ Thusly sentient beings
                                are liberated without measure, without number, and to no end;
                                however, truly no sentient beings obtain liberation. Why? Subhūti,
                                if a bodhisattva has a notion of a self, a notion of a person, a
                                notion of a being, or a notion of a life, he is not a
                                bodhisattva.</p><p>4. The wondrous practice of non-abiding</p><p>“Moreover, Subhūti, bodhisattvas should not abide in dharmas when
                                practicing giving. This is called ‘giving without abiding in form.’
                                This giving does not abide in sounds, scents, tastes, sensations, or
                                dharmas. Subhūti, bodhisattvas should practice giving thusly, not
                                abiding in characteristics. Why? If bodhisattvas do not abide in
                                characteristics in their practice of giving, then the merits of this
                                are inconceivable and immeasurable. Subhūti, what do you think? Is
                                the space to the east conceivable or measurable?” “Certainly not,
                                Bhagavān.” “Subhūti, what do you think? Is the space to the south,
                                west, north, the four intermediary directions, or the zenith or
                                nadir, conceivable or measurable?” “Certainly not, Bhagavān.”
                                “Subhūti, for bodhisattvas who do not abide when practicing giving,
                                the merits are also such as this: inconceivable and immeasurable.
                                Subhūti, bodhisattvas should only dwell in what is taught
                                thusly.</p><p>5. The principle for true perception</p><p>“Subhūti, what do you think? Can the Tathāgata be perceived by means
                                of bodily marks?” “Certainly not, Bhagavān. The Tathāgata cannot be
                                perceived by means of the bodily marks. Why? The bodily marks that
                                the Tathāgata speaks of are not bodily marks.” The Buddha told
                                Subhūti, “Everything that has marks is deceptive and false. If all
                                marks are not seen as marks, then this is perceiving the
                                Tathāgata.”</p><p>6. The rarity of true belief</p><p>Subhūti addressed the Buddha, saying, “Bhagavān, will there be
                                sentient beings who are able to hear these words thusly, giving rise
                                to true belief?” The Buddha told to Subhūti, “Do not speak that way.
                                After the extinction of the Tathāgata, in the next five hundred
                                years, there will be those who maintain the precepts and cultivate
                                merit, who will be able to hear these words and give rise to a mind
                                of belief. Such beings have not just planted good roots with one
                                buddha, or with two buddhas, or with three, four, or five buddhas.
                                They have already planted good roots with measureless millions of
                                buddhas, to be able to hear these words and give rise to even a
                                single thought of clean, clear belief. Subhūti, the Tathāgata in
                                each case knows this, and in each case perceives this, and these
                                sentient beings thus attain immeasurable merit. Why? This is because
                                these beings are holding no further notions of a self, notions of a
                                person, notions of a being, or notions of a life. They are holding
                                no notions of dharmas and no notions of non-dharmas. Why? If the
                                minds of sentient beings grasp after appearances, then this is
                                attachment to a self, a person, a being, and a life. If they grasp
                                after notions of dharmas, that is certainly attachment to a self, a
                                person, a being, and a life. Why? When one grasps at non-dharmas,
                                then that is immediate attachment to a self, a person, a being, and
                                a life. Therefore, you should neither grasp at dharmas, nor should
                                you grasp at non-dharmas. Regarding this principle, the Tathāgata
                                frequently says, ‘You bhikṣus should know that the dharma I speak is
                                like a raft. Even dharmas should be relinquished, so how much more
                                so the non-dharmas?’</p><p>7. No obtaining, no expounding</p><p>“Subhūti, what do you think? Has the Tathāgata obtained Anuttarā
                                Samyaksaṃbodhi? Is there any dharma the Tathāgata has spoken?”
                                Subhūti replied, “Thus do I explain the true meaning of the Buddha’s
                                teachings: there is no fixed dharma of Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi, nor
                                is there a fixed dharma the Tathāgata can speak. Why? The
                                Tathāgata’s exposition of the Dharma can never be grasped or spoken,
                                being neither dharma nor non-dharma. What is it, then? All the noble
                                ones are distinguished by the unconditioned Dharma.”</p><p>8. Emerging from the Dharma</p><p>“Subhūti, what do you think? If someone filled the three thousand
                                great thousand-worlds with the Seven Precious Jewels in the practice
                                of giving, would such a person obtain many merits?” Subhūti replied,
                                “Very many, Bhagavān! Why? Such merits do not have the nature of
                                merits, and for this reason the Tathāgata speaks of many merits.”
                                “If a person accepts and maintains even as little as a four-line
                                gāthā from within this sūtra, speaking it to others, then his or her
                                merits will be even greater. Why? Subhūti, this is because all
                                buddhas, as well as the dharmas of the Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi of
                                the buddhas, emerge from this sūtra. Subhūti, what is called the
                                Buddha Dharma is not a buddha dharma.</p><p>9. The appearance without appearance</p><p>“Subhūti, what do you think? Does a srotaāpanna have the thought, ‘I
                                have obtained the fruit of a srotaāpanna?’” Subhūti replied, “No,
                                Bhagavān. Why? ‘Srotaāpanna’ refers to one who has entered the
                                stream, yet there is nothing entered into. There is no entry into
                                forms, sounds, scents, tastes, sensations, or dharmas. Thus is one
                                called a srotaāpanna.” “Subhūti, what do you think? Does a
                                sakṛdāgāmin have the thought, ‘I have obtained the fruit of a
                                sakṛdāgāmin?’” Subhūti replied, “No, Bhagavān. Why? ‘Sakṛdāgāmin’
                                refers to one who will return once more, yet there is nothing which
                                leaves or returns. Thus is one called a sakṛdāgāmin.” “Subhūti, what
                                do you think? Does an anāgāmin have the thought, ‘I have obtained
                                the fruit of an anāgāmin?’” Subhūti replied, “No, Bhagavān. Why?
                                ‘Anāgāmin’ refers to one who will not return, yet there is nothing
                                non-returning. Thus is one called an anāgāmin.”</p><p>“Subhūti, what do you think? Does an arhat have the thought, ‘I have
                                obtained the fruit of an arhat?’” Subhūti replied, “No, Bhagavān.
                                Why? There is truly no dharma which may be called an arhat.
                                Bhagavān, if an arhat has the thought, ‘I have attained the Arhat
                                Path,’ then this is a person attached to a self, a person, a being,
                                and a life. Bhagavān, the Buddha says that among arhats, I am the
                                foremost in my practice of the Samādhi of Non-contention, and am the
                                foremost free of desire. However, Bhagavān, I do not have the
                                thought, ‘I am an arhat free of desire.’ If I were thinking this
                                way, then the Bhagavān would not speak of ‘Subhūti, the one who
                                dwells in peace.’ It is because there is truly nothing dwelled in,
                                that he speaks of ‘Subhūti, the one who dwells in peace.’”</p><p>10. The adornment of pure lands</p><p>The Buddha addressed Subhūti, saying, “What do you think? In the past
                                when the Tathāgata was with Dīpaṃkara Buddha, was there any dharma
                                obtained?” “No, Bhagavān. When the Tathāgata was with Dīpaṃkara
                                Buddha there was truly no dharma obtained.” “Subhūti, what do you
                                think? Do bodhisattvas adorn buddha-lands?” “No, Bhagavān. Why? The
                                adornments of buddha-lands are not adornments, and are thus called
                                adornments.” “Therefore, Subhūti, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas should
                                thusly give rise to a clear and pure mind—a mind not associated with
                                abiding in form; a mind not associated with abiding in sounds,
                                scents, tastes, sensations, or dharmas; a mind not abiding in life.
                                Subhūti, suppose a person had a body like Mount Sumeru, King of
                                Mountains. Would this body be great?” Subhūti replied, “It would be
                                extremely great, Bhagavān. Why? The Buddha teaches that no body is
                                the Great Body.”</p><p>11. Unconditioned merits surpass all</p><p>“Subhūti, suppose each sand grain in the Ganges River, contained its
                                own Ganges River. What do you think, would there be many grains of
                                sand of the Ganges River?” Subhūti said, “There would be extremely
                                many, Bhagavān. The number of Ganges Rivers alone would be
                                countless, let alone their grains of sand.” “Subhūti, I will now
                                tell you a truth. If a good man or good woman filled such a number
                                of three thousand great thousand-worlds with the Seven Precious
                                Jewels in the practice of giving, would he or she obtain many
                                merits?” Subhūti said, “Extremely many, Bhagavān.” The Buddha told
                                Subhūti, “Just so, if good men and good women accept and maintain
                                even a four-line gāthā from within this sūtra, speaking it to
                                others, then the merits of this surpass the former merits.</p><p>12. Venerating the true teachings</p><p>“Moreover, Subhūti, if one speaks even a four-line gāthā from within
                                this sūtra, you should understand that this place is like the shrine
                                of a buddha. In every world, the devas, humans, and asuras should
                                provide offerings to it. How much more so for those capable of
                                accepting and maintaining the entire sūtra? Subhūti, you should know
                                that this is a person with the highest and most exceptional Dharma.
                                Wherever this sūtra dwells is the Buddha or an honored
                                disciple.”</p><p>13. Receiving and maintaining the Dharma</p><p>Subhūti asked the Buddha, “Bhagavān, by what name should we revere
                                and maintain this sūtra?” The Buddha told Subhūti, “This sūtra is
                                called the Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā, and by this name you should
                                revere and maintain it. Why is it called this? Subhūti, this
                                Prajñāpāramitā spoken by the Buddha is not a perfection of prajñā.
                                Subhūti, what do you think? Has the Tathāgata actually spoken any
                                dharma?” Subhūti replied, “Bhagavān, the Tathāgata has not spoken.”
                                “Subhūti, what do you think? Are there very many atoms contained in
                                three thousand great thousand-worlds?” Subhūti replied, “There are
                                extremely many, Bhagavān.” “Subhūti, the atoms spoken of by the
                                Tathāgata are not atoms, and are thus called atoms. The worlds
                                spoken of by the Tathāgata are not worlds, and are thus called
                                worlds. Subhūti, what do you think? Can the Tathāgata be seen by
                                means of the Thirty-two Marks?” “No, Bhagavān, the Tathāgata cannot
                                be seen by means of the Thirty-two Marks. Why? The Thirty-two Marks
                                that the Tathāgata speaks of are not marks, and are thus called the
                                Thirty-two Marks.” “Subhūti, suppose there were a good man or good
                                woman who, in the practice of giving, gave his or her body away as
                                many times as there are sand grains in the Ganges River. If there
                                are people who accept and maintain even a four-line gāthā from
                                within this sūtra, then the merits of this are far greater.”</p><p>14. Leaving appearances: Nirvāṇa</p><p>At that time, Subhūti, hearing this sūtra being spoken, had a
                                profound understanding of its essential meaning, and burst into
                                tears. He then addressed the Buddha, saying, “How exceptional,
                                Bhagavān, is the Buddha who thus speaks this profound sūtra! Since
                                attaining the Eye of Prajñā, I have never heard such a sūtra!
                                Bhagavān, if there are again people who are able to hear this sūtra
                                thusly, with a mind of clean and clear belief, giving rise to the
                                true appearance, then this is a person with the most extraordinary
                                merits. Bhagavān, the true appearance is not an appearance, and for
                                this reason the Tathāgata speaks of a true appearance.</p><p>“Bhagavān, being able to hear this sūtra thusly, I do not find it
                                difficult to believe, understand, accept, and maintain it. However,
                                in the next era, five hundred years from now, if there are sentient
                                beings who are able to hear this sūtra and believe, understand,
                                accept, and maintain it, then they will be most extraordinary. Why?
                                This is because such a person has no notions of a self, notions of a
                                person, notions of a being, or notions of a life. Why? The
                                appearance of a self is not a true appearance; appearances of a
                                person, a being, and a life, are also not true appearances. Those
                                who have departed from all appearances are called buddhas.” The
                                Buddha told Subhūti, “Thusly, thusly! If there are again people who
                                are able to hear this sūtra, and are not startled, terrified, or
                                fearful, know that the existence of such a person is extremely rare.
                                Why? Subhūti, this foremost pāramitā that the Tathāgata speaks of is
                                not a foremost pāramitā, and is thus called the foremost
                                pāramitā.</p><p>“Subhūti, the Pāramitā of Forbearance that the Tathāgata speaks of is
                                not a pāramitā of forbearance. Why? Subhūti, this is like in the
                                past when my body was cut apart by the Kalirāja: there were no
                                notions of a self, notions of a person, notions of a being, or
                                notions of a life. In the past, when I was being hacked limb from
                                limb, if there were notions of a self, notions of a person, notions
                                of a being, or notions of a life, then I would have responded with
                                hatred and anger. Remember also that I was the Ṛṣi of Forbearance
                                for five hundred lifetimes in the past. Over so many lifetimes there
                                were no notions of a self, notions of a person, notions of a being,
                                or notions of a life.</p><p>“Therefore, Subhūti, bodhisattvas should depart from all appearances
                                in order to develop the mind of Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi. They should
                                give rise to a mind which does not dwell in form; they should give
                                rise to a mind which does not dwell in sounds, scents, tastes,
                                sensations, or dharmas; they should give rise to a mind which does
                                not dwell. In anything that dwells in the mind, one should not
                                dwell, and for this reason the Buddha says that the minds of
                                bodhisattvas should not dwell in form when practicing giving.
                                Subhūti, bodhisattvas should give thusly because it benefits all
                                sentient beings. The Tathāgata teaches that all characteristics are
                                not characteristics, and all sentient beings are not sentient
                                beings. Subhūti, the Tathāgata is one who speaks what is true, one
                                who speaks what is real, one who speaks what is thus, and is not a
                                deceiver or one who speaks to the contrary.</p><p>“Subhūti, the Dharma attained by the Tathāgata is neither substantial
                                nor void. Subhūti, if the mind of a bodhisattva dwells in dharmas
                                when practicing giving, then this is like a person in darkness who
                                is unable to see anything. However, if the mind of a bodhisattva
                                does not dwell in dharmas when practicing giving, then this is like
                                a person who is able to see, for whom sunlight clearly illuminates
                                the perception of various forms. Subhūti, in the next era, if there
                                are good men or good women capable of accepting, maintaining,
                                studying, and reciting this sūtra, then the Tathāgata by means of
                                his buddha-wisdom is always aware of them and always sees them.
                                These people all obtain immeasurable, limitless merit.</p><p>15. The merits of maintaining this sūtra</p><p>“Subhūti, suppose there were a good man or a good woman who, in the
                                morning, gave his or her body away as many times as there are grains
                                of sand in the Ganges River. In the middle of the day, this person
                                would also give his or her body away as many times as there are
                                grains of sand in the Ganges River. Then in the evening, this person
                                would also give his or her body away as many times as there are
                                grains of sand in the Ganges River. Suppose this giving continued
                                for incalculable billions of eons. If there are people again who
                                hear this sūtra with a mind of belief, without doubt, then the
                                merits of these people surpass the former merits. How much more so
                                for those who write, accept, maintain, study, recite, and explain
                                it?</p><p>“Subhūti, to summarize, this sūtra has inconceivable, immeasurable,
                                limitless merit. The Tathāgata speaks it to send forth those in the
                                Great Vehicle, to send forth those in the Supreme Vehicle. If there
                                are people able to accept, maintain, study, recite, and explain this
                                sūtra to others, then the Tathāgata is always aware of them and
                                always sees them. Thusly, these people are carrying the Anuttarā
                                Samyaksaṃbodhi of the Tathāgata. Why? Subhūti, those who are happy
                                with lesser teachings are attached to views of a self, views of a
                                person, views of a being, and views of a life. They cannot hear,
                                accept, maintain, study, recite, and explain it to others. Subhūti,
                                in every place where this sūtra exists, the devas, humans, and
                                asuras from every world should provide offerings. This place is a
                                shrine to which everyone should respectfully make obeisance and
                                circumambulate, adorning its resting place with flowers and
                                incense.</p><p>16. Able to purify obstructions</p><p>“Moreover, Subhūti, suppose good men and good women accept, maintain,
                                study, and recite this sūtra. If they are treated badly due to karma
                                from a previous life that would make them fall onto evil paths, then
                                from this treatment by others their karma from previous lives will
                                be eliminated in this lifetime, and they will attain Anuttarā
                                Samyaksaṃbodhi. Subhūti, I remember in the past, innumerable,
                                incalculable eons before Dīpaṃkara Buddha, being able to meet 84,000
                                countless myriads of buddhas, and providing offerings to honor them
                                all without exception. Suppose someone in the next era is able to
                                accept, maintain, study, and recite this sūtra. The merits of my
                                offerings to all those buddhas are, in comparison to the merits of
                                this person, not even one hundredth as good. They are so vastly
                                inferior that a comparison cannot be made. Subhūti, if there are
                                good men and good women in the next era who accept, maintain, study,
                                and recite this sūtra, and I were to fully explain all the merits
                                attained, the minds of those listening could go mad with confusion,
                                full of doubt and disbelief. Subhūti, understand that just as the
                                meaning of this sūtra is inconceivable, its rewards of karma are
                                also inconceivable.”</p><p>17. Ultimately without self</p><p>At that time, Subhūti addressed the Buddha, saying, “Bhagavān, when
                                good men and good women develop the mind of Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi,
                                how should their minds dwell? How should they pacify their minds?”
                                The Buddha told Subhūti, “Good men and good women develop Anuttarā
                                Samyaksaṃbodhi by giving rise to a mind thusly: ‘I will liberate all
                                sentient beings. Yet when all sentient beings have been liberated,
                                then truly not even a single sentient being has been liberated.’
                                Why? Subhūti, a bodhisattva who has a notion of a self, a notion of
                                a person, a notion of a being, or a notion of a life, is not a
                                bodhisattva. Why is this so? Subhūti, there is actually no dharma of
                                one who develops Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi.</p><p>“What do you think? When the Tathāgata was with Dīpaṃkara Buddha, was
                                there any dharma of the attainment of Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi?” “No,
                                Bhagavān, and thus do I explain the actual meaning of the Buddha’s
                                teachings: when the Buddha was with Dīpaṃkara Buddha, there was
                                truly no dharma of the attainment of Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi.” The
                                Buddha said, “Thusly, thusly, Subhūti! There was no dharma of the
                                Tathāgata’s attainment of Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi. Subhūti, if there
                                were a dharma of the Tathāgata’s attainment of Anuttarā
                                Samyaksaṃbodhi, then Dīpaṃkara Buddha would not have given me the
                                prediction, ‘In the next era you will become a buddha named
                                Śākyamuni.’ It is because there was no dharma of the attainment of
                                Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi, that Dīpaṃkara Buddha gave me this
                                prediction by saying, ‘In the next era you will become a buddha
                                named Śākyamuni.’ Why? ‘Tathāgata’ has the meaning of the suchness
                                of dharmas. Subhūti, if someone says, ‘The Tathāgata has attained
                                Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi,’ there is no dharma of a buddha’s
                                attainment of Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi.</p><p>“Subhūti, the true attainment by the Tathāgata of Anuttarā
                                Samyaksaṃbodhi is neither substantial nor void, and for this reason
                                the Tathāgata says, ‘All dharmas are the Buddha Dharma.’ Subhūti,
                                all dharmas spoken of are actually not all dharmas, and are thus
                                called all dharmas. Subhūti, this is like the body of a person that
                                is tall and great.” Subhūti said, “Bhagavān, the body of a person
                                that the Tathāgata speaks of, tall and great, is not a great body,
                                and is thus called the Great Body.” “Subhūti, for bodhisattvas it is
                                also such as this. If someone says ‘I will liberate and cross over
                                innumerable sentient beings,’ then this is not one to be called a
                                bodhisattva. Why? Subhūti, truly there is no dharma of a
                                bodhisattva, and for this reason the Buddha says, ‘All dharmas are
                                not a self, a person, a being, or a life.’ Subhūti, if a bodhisattva
                                says, ‘I am adorning buddha-lands,’ then this is not one to be
                                called a bodhisattva. Why? The adornments of buddha-lands spoken of
                                by the Tathāgata are not adornments, and are thus called adornments.
                                Subhūti, if a bodhisattva has penetrating realization that dharmas
                                are without self, then the Tathāgata says, ‘This is a true
                                bodhisattva.’</p><p>18. Of a single unified perception</p><p>“Subhūti, what do you think? Does the Tathāgata have the Physical
                                Eye?” “Thusly, Bhagavān, the Tathāgata has the Physical Eye.”
                                “Subhūti, what do you think? Does the Tathāgata have the Divine
                                Eye?” “Thusly, Bhagavān, the Tathāgata has the Divine Eye.”
                                “Subhūti, what do you think? Does the Tathāgata have the Prajñā
                                Eye?” “Thusly, Bhagavān, the Tathāgata has the Prajñā Eye.”
                                “Subhūti, what do you think? Does the Tathāgata have the Dharma
                                Eye?” “Thusly, Bhagavān, the Tathāgata has the Dharma Eye.”
                                “Subhūti, what do you think? Does the Tathāgata have the Buddha
                                Eye?” “Thusly, Bhagavān, the Tathāgata has the Buddha Eye.” Subhūti,
                                what do you think? Regarding the sand grains of the Ganges River,
                                does the Buddha speak of these grains of sand?” “Thusly, Bhagavān,
                                the Tathāgata speaks of these grains of sand.” “If there were as
                                many Ganges Rivers as there are sand grains in the Ganges River, and
                                there were such buddha world realms as there were sand grains in all
                                those Ganges Rivers, would their number be very many?” “It would be
                                extremely many, Bhagavān.” The Buddha told Subhūti, “Such a number
                                of lands possess a multitude of sentient beings, and their minds are
                                fully known by the Tathāgata. Why? The minds that the Tathāgata
                                speaks of are not minds, and are thus called minds. Why is this so?
                                Subhūti, past mind cannot be grasped, present mind cannot be
                                grasped, and future mind cannot be grasped.</p><p>19. Pervading the Dharma Realm</p><p>“Subhūti, what do you think? If someone filled three thousand great
                                thousand-worlds with the Seven Precious Jewels, and gave them away
                                in the practice of giving, would this person obtain many merits from
                                such causes and conditions?” “Thusly, Bhagavān, from such causes and
                                conditions, the merits of this person would be extremely many.”
                                “Subhūti, if such merits truly existed, then the Tathāgata would not
                                say that many merits that are obtained. It is from the merits that
                                are unconditioned, that the Tathāgata speaks of obtaining many
                                merits.</p><p>20. Leaving form, leaving appearance</p><p>“Subhūti, what do you think? Can the Tathāgata be seen by means of
                                the perfected body of form?” “No, Bhagavān, the Tathāgata cannot be
                                seen by means of the perfected body of form. Why? The perfected body
                                of form that the Tathāgata speaks of is itself not a perfected body
                                of form, and is thus called the perfected body of form.” “Subhūti,
                                what do you think? Can the Tathāgata be seen by the perfection of
                                all marks?” “No, Bhagavān, the Tathāgata cannot be seen by the
                                perfection of all marks. Why? The perfection of marks that the
                                Tathāgata speaks of is itself not a perfection, and is thus called
                                the perfection of marks.”</p><p>21. No speaking, no dharma to speak</p><p>“Subhūti, do not say that it occurs to the Tathāgata, ‘I have a
                                spoken Dharma.’ Do not compose this thought. Why? If someone says
                                ‘The Tathāgata has a spoken Dharma,’ then this is like slandering
                                the Buddha, because my teachings have not been understood. Subhūti,
                                one who speaks the Dharma is unable to speak any dharma, and it is
                                thus called speaking the Dharma.” At that time, Living Wisdom
                                Subhūti addressed the Buddha, saying, “Bhagavān, will there be
                                sentient beings in the next era who will hear this spoken dharma and
                                give rise to a mind of belief?” The Buddha replied, “Subhūti, there
                                will be neither sentient beings nor will there not be sentient
                                beings. Why? Subhūti, the sentient beings that the Tathāgata speaks
                                of are not sentient beings, and are thus called sentient
                                beings.”</p><p>22. No dharmas may be grasped</p><p>Subhūti asked the Buddha, “Bhagavān, is the Buddha’s attainment of
                                Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi actually without attainment?” “Thusly,
                                thusly, Subhūti. With regard to my Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi, there is
                                not even the slightest dharma of Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi which may
                                be grasped.</p><p>23. The virtuous practice of a pure mind</p><p>“Moreover, Subhūti, the equality of dharmas that has nothing that is
                                better or worse, is called Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi, and by means of
                                no self, no person, no being, and no life, all pure dharmas are
                                cultivated and Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi is attained. Subhūti, these
                                pure dharmas that the Tathāgata speaks of are not pure dharmas, and
                                are thus called pure dharmas.</p><p>24. The merits of prajñā are incomparable</p><p>“Subhūti, suppose three thousand great thousand-worlds all contained
                                Sumeru, King of Mountains, and there were mountains such as this of
                                the Seven Precious Jewels, given away by someone in the practice of
                                giving. If a person has only a four-line gāthā from this
                                Prajñāpāramitā sūtra, and accepts, maintains, studies, recites, and
                                speaks it for others, then the merits of the other person are not
                                even one hundredth as good. They are so vastly inferior that the two
                                are incomparable.</p><p>25. Transformations are not transformations</p><p>“Subhūti, what do you think? You should not say that it occurs to the
                                Tathāgata, ‘I will cross over sentient beings.’ Subhūti, do not
                                compose this thought. Why? Truly there are no sentient beings
                                crossed over by the Tathāgata. If there were sentient beings crossed
                                over by the Tathāgata, then there would be a self, a person, a
                                being, and a life. The existence of a self that the Tathāgata speaks
                                of is not the existence of a self, but ordinary people believe it is
                                a self. Subhūti, an ordinary person that the Tathāgata speaks of is
                                not an ordinary person.</p><p>26. The Dharmakāya is without appearance</p><p>“Subhūti, what do you think? Can the Tathāgata be observed by means
                                of the Thirty-two Marks?” Subhūti replied, “Thusly, thusly, with the
                                Thirty-two Marks the Tathāgata is to be observed.” The Buddha said,
                                “Subhūti, if the Tathāgata could be observed by means of the
                                Thirty-two Marks, then a cakravartin king would be a tathāgata.”
                                Subhūti addressed the Buddha, saying, “Bhagavān, thus do I explain
                                the meaning of what the Buddha has said. One should not observe the
                                Tathāgata by means of the Thirty-two Marks.” At that time, the
                                Bhagavān spoke a gāthā, saying:</p><lg><l>If one perceives me in forms,</l><l>If one listens for me in sounds,</l><l>This person practices a deviant path</l><l>And cannot see the Tathāgata.</l></lg><p>27. No severing, no annihilation</p><p>“Subhūti, suppose you think, ‘The Tathāgata has not, from the
                                perfection of characteristics, attained Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi.’
                                Subhūti, do not compose the thought, ‘The Tathāgata has not, from
                                the perfection of characteristics, attained Anuttarā
                                Samyaksaṃbodhi.’ Subhūti, composing this thought, the one who is
                                developing the mind of Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi is then speaking of
                                the severence and annihilation of dharmas. Do not compose this
                                thought. Why? One who is developing the mind of Anuttarā
                                Samyaksaṃbodhi does not speak of a characteristic of the severence
                                and annihilation of dharmas.</p><p>28. Not receiving, not desiring</p><p>“Subhūti, suppose a bodhisattva, in the practice of giving, filled as
                                many world realms with the Seven Precious Jewels, as there are
                                grains of sand in the Ganges River. If there is a person with the
                                awareness that all dharmas are without self, and accomplishes their
                                complete endurance, then this is superior, and the merits attained
                                by this bodhisattva surpass those of the previous bodhisattva.
                                Subhūti, the reason for this is that bodhisattvas do not receive
                                merit.” Subhūti addressed the Buddha, saying, “Bhagavān, why do you
                                say that bodhisattvas do not receive merit?” “Subhūti, for
                                bodhisattvas to make merit, they should not greedily wish to acquire
                                it, and therefore it is said that there is no merit received.</p><p>29. Power and position destroyed in silence</p><p>“Subhūti, if someone says that the Tathāgata comes, goes, sits, or
                                lies down, then this person does not understand the meaning of my
                                teachings. Why? The Tathāgata is one who neither comes nor goes
                                anywhere, and for this reason is called the Tathāgata.</p><p>30. The principle of the unity of appearances</p><p>“Subhūti, if a good man or good woman disintegrated three thousand
                                great thousand-worlds into atoms, would these atoms be very many in
                                number?” “They would be extremely many, Bhagavān. Why? If this
                                multitude of atoms truly existed, then the Buddha would not speak of
                                a multitude of atoms. Yet the Buddha does speak of a multitude of
                                atoms, and therefore the multitude of atoms spoken of by the Buddha
                                is not a multitude of atoms, and is thus called a multitude of
                                atoms. Bhagavān, the three thousand great thousand-worlds that the
                                Tathāgata speaks of are not worlds, and are thus called worlds. Why?
                                The existence of these worlds is like a single unified appearance.
                                Why? The unified appearance that the Tathāgata speaks of is not a
                                unified appearance, and is thus called the unified appearance.”
                                “Subhūti, one who is of the unified characteristic is unable to
                                speak it, and yet ordinary people greedily wish to acquire it.</p><p>31. Unborn knowing and perceiving</p><p>“Subhūti, suppose a person says, ‘The Buddha teaches views of a self,
                                a person, a being, and a life.’ Subhūti, what do you think? Does
                                this person understand the meaning of my teachings?” “No, Bhagavān,
                                this person does not understand the meaning of the Tathāgata’s
                                teachings. Why? The views of a self, a person, a being, and a life,
                                that the Bhagavān speaks of, are not views of a self, a person, a
                                being, or a life, and are thus called the views of a self, a person,
                                a being, and a life.” “Subhūti, regarding all dharmas, one who is
                                developing the mind of Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi should thusly know,
                                thusly see, and thusly believe, not giving rise to notions of
                                dharmas. Subhūti, the true characteristic of dharmas is not a
                                characteristic of dharmas, and is thus called the characteristic of
                                dharmas.</p><p>32. Transforming the unreal</p><p>“Subhūti, suppose someone filled immeasurable, innumerable worlds
                                with the Seven Precious Jewels, and then gave these away in the
                                practice of giving. If a good man or good woman develops the mind of
                                a bodhisattva and maintains this sūtra, even with as little as a
                                four-line gāthā, and accepts, maintains, studies, recites, and
                                explains it to others, then the merits of this surpass the others.
                                How should one explain it? Without grasping at characteristics, in
                                unmoving suchness. For what reason?</p><lg><l>All conditioned dharmas</l><l>Are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, or shadows;</l><l>Like drops of dew, or like flashes of lightning;</l><l>Thusly should they be contemplated.</l></lg><p>After the Buddha had spoken this sūtra, then Elder Subhūti along with
                                all the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, and the devas,
